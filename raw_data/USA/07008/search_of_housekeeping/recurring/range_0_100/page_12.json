If you need help with cooking, deep cleaning, or organizing I can help you with that. I usually don't provide the cleaning supplies because each home has different needs. I have no problem cleaning bathrooms, mopping, dusting, wiping, helping with pets, or taking out the garbage, or getting the recycling ready. Whatever you need. I know I like cleaning and folding done a specific way in my home so I will do my best to do the same for yours once I learn your likes and dislikes. I'm also a big fan of DE-cluttering. If there are items in your home that you feel you no longer want or need I'd love to help. I can change your sheets, vacuum, clean out the fridge, garage, or help organize your attic. I am a single mother of an 8-year-old beauty so I am also very comfortable with children. (Pets too!) I also water your plants, help with your car, just let me know! :)",
