Both of our daughters have special needs and Corinne has experience in this area. She was also willing and eager to attend their virtual therapy sessions, in order learn about things that would help improve them develop. She has made numerous suggestions to my husband and I regarding supplemental aids to purchase to assist the girls development, which we have acted upon. She has transformed one room into a mini classroom, which has been priceless. We are grateful for the compassion and care she has displayed for our children and family. We highly recommend her!!",
