Right away we loved her and she has been working with us regularly (at least 1-2 times per week) since then.  We trust her with caring for our (now two) dogs, caring for our home when we travel, assisting us when we’re entertaining, and with housekeeping.  If we had a human child of our own, I can say with 100% certainty she would be working with us full-time. She is a grandmother, an educated and well mannered former school administrator, she is always (without exception) punctual and reliable, and is very sweet and always looking for ways to take care of us.  Any family would be lucky to have Martha in their lives. I am happy to provide references.  - Danielle",
