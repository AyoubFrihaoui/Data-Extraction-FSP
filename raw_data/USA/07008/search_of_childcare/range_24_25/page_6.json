I have a proven track record of providing safe, nurturing, and engaging childcare experiences for kids of all ages, including twins.\n\nI am a non-smoker with a clean driving record and am CPR certified. Additionally, I am bilingual in Spanish and also have some knowledge of Portuguese. My ability to communicate effectively in multiple languages allows me to connect with children from diverse backgrounds.",
