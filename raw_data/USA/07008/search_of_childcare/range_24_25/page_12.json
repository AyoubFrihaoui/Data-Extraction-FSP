I have lived in Scotch Plains for past 16 years where I raised my own two children. I am full of energy, passion and love for working with children of all ages.\nA bit of my own story: I graduated from the University of Warsaw, Poland in 1985 (MA in Early Child Development and Special Education). Since then, I have worked as a caregiver in numerous settings. I have more than 10 years of paid experience as a Nanny.\n I am gifted in developing and implementing quality activities in arts and crafts, fine arts, drama, music, cognitive games, and basic skills in education/homework. I speak fluent English. I possess First Aid and CPR certifications. I have my own car and a clean driving record. It would be my pleasure to help you with any childcare, housekeeping, errands or transportation needs you may have. Also, I am able to travel domestically and internationally on very short notice.\nOn a personal note, I am an avid runner, swimming enthusiast, animal lover, and a pretty good baker.\nI would welcome the opportunity to speak with you about how I could provide the best care for your children and your household.\nThank you for your kind consideration.",

I have 3 nieces of my own , twin 1-year-olds and a 4-year-old, all who I love dearly and have given me ample experience multitasking ! My school work does not allow me to have a 9-5 job which is why babysitting is alluring to me because I get to build relationships with families and their kids that benefit my career down the line and the hours allow me to actually work through my semesters!

Additionally I am free on weekends to provide childcare for a family that needs it. \nI am patient, dedicated, and caring, as well as determined to make a positive impact on any child and family I am more than willing to assist in online schooling, homework, or tutoring.
