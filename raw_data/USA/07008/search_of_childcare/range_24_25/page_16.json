I strive to provide such a setting for the children in my care.\n\nI'm patient, calm, and creative, and I love playing games with children. I also believe in open communication with parents and will provide regular updates on your child's day and any issues that arise. I'm comfortable enforcing household rules and am happy to work with you to create a consistent and structured environment for your child.\n\nI have a college degree and am certified in CPR and First Aid. I'm also comfortable caring for children of all ages, from infants to teenagers. I have a car and am comfortable with dogs (allergic to cats).\n\nI look forward to meeting you and your family and providing your child with the best possible care.",

I helped them full time with their daily routine like driving them to school and activities, meals, play and laundry.\n\n> Strong swimmer\n> Safe Driver\n> CPR certified\n> First Aid Training\n> Special Needs Childcare\n> Own Transportation\n> Non-Smoker\n> COVID Vaccinated-Booster\n> Flu vaccinated\n\nLet's chat!!",

I currently work at a public school in a preschool classroom. I love taking care of children and seeing them grow and thrive. I have a college degree and I am currently working on my CDA certification. I do drive. I don't smoke. I have first aid and CPR certifications. I have references available if needed. Thank you",

Even when the kids were resting/napping she was often turning over the dishwasher or folding clothes for us, even though we let her know that she was more than welcome to take a rest as well. Susan would think of new, fun and creative activities to do with the kids and I feel like they have grown and learned a lot this summer with her. I would highly recommend her!",
