I'm offering child care and household services. I love being a baby sitter, I love being able to help children. I have experience working with newborns, infants, toddlers and older children as well. I've been watching children since I was about 15 years old. My responsibilities have included helping with homework, doing arts and crafts and even some play time.\nI was once a paraprofessional, I was working with children with disabilities all ages. So that's a plus. I also was a teacher assistant with children age 2\nI'm very good at cooking, cleaning and even running errands as well. I've been a caretaker before, I was working with a young girl for some time. I've also had experience with senior care, I helped out my grandmother for sometime. I ran errands for her, cook for her.\nI'd describe my personality as helpful, loving, caring, happy, energetic",

I've worked with kids ranging from 3 months to 16 years old. \nI am available day or night, weekdays and weeknights. I am comfortable with pets, okay with light housekeeping, and have my own car (also familiar with subways and getting around the city) I am willing to do one-time babysitting or as needed while I am in town. \nFeel free to contact me for any questions. \nCheers!",

I am quick to act in an emergency and I take safety seriously.\n\nMy skills include maintaining and monitoring safety, preparing balanced meals, and assisting with learning and development.

As the youngest of 9 in my own family, I became an aunt at 5 years old. My oldest nephew was followed by 25 more nieces and nephews. Many years later I am a great aunt to 34 beautiful children. I am also a mother of 2 adult boys. Aside from my personal experience, I've worked as a preschool teacher since 1998. Over these years, I believe that each and every child I've taught has been a blessing to me. Children are so precious, so gifted, and so special in their unique personalities. It has been my lifelong objective to teach children love, kindness, respect, curiousity for learning and an enthusiasm for everything beautiful their lives have to offer.",
