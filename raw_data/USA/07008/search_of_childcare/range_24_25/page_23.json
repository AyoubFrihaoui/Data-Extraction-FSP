I started with babysitting my nephew and nieces, and then I worked as a counselor in charge of a group of 10 preteens at a camp for children with brain injuries. After some retail work, I went to college, pursued a degree in psychology, and then continued to nurture my love of children by working as a bus aide, a behavioral therapist for kids and teens with developmental disabilities, and then as a nanny for a family with two children. I love getting to know children and helping them to cultivate their intellect and creativity. Safety and happiness are always paramount when it comes to my work, and it's pretty much a guarantee that I'll come to love the kids as my own.",
