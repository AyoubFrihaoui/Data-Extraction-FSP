My college degree is Early Childhood Education/Family Studies and I'm also a certified parent educator and passed the INA Nanny Basic Skills Assessment. I'm also a mama to a sweet 3-year-old little boy! \n\nI love to stay active so I'm hoping to work with a family who loves adventures and the outdoors. I also love arts and crafts (and do many Waldorf based activities), reading, and baking. I love working with children and seeing them blossom into their own person. My background in Montessori has taught me great respect for children and their abilities and therefore I think children should have their needs met and their voices heard.",
