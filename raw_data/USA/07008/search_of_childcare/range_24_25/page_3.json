I have experience watching over children and helping with their needs. In the summer of 2017, I was given a chance to work around children and since then I've spent my summers as a counselor, teacher, and assistant working with different age groups in various environments such as camps and daycares. I have over 7 years of experience. I often travel through the boroughs to try new restaurants, visit new places or go to dance classes so I'm open to babysitting anywhere! I like to spend my free time reading, dancing, cooking, doing yoga and trying new hobbies such as roller skating. I would describe myself as being kind, creative, respectful and adventurous. I'm open to working late and I'm great with pets. I'm looking forward to being an addition to your family and creating a safe place and comfortable atmosphere for your children to thrive in.",
