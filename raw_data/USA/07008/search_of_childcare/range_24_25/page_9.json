I have a background child psych and have obtained my applied behavioral analysis certificate which has allowed me the opportunity to work with children on the spectrum. I am also certified in basic life support which includes CPR. \n\nI have a double bachelors (bio and psych) and a masters in neuroscience. Prior to my medical career, I worked as a professor as well as an ABA therapist. \n\nPrior to my medical career I was a competitive dancer and enjoyed other forms of art. Therefore, I am a perfect choice for creative families who enjoy doing crafts, or families who prefer to limit screen time.\n\n**Please note that I will be returning to school in July**\n\n Please contact me with any additional questions!",
