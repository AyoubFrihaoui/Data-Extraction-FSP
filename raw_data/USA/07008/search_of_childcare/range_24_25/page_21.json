At 21 I left my home country ( Brazil ) and moved to the United States to study and work with children as a nanny live-in, I stayed for 1 year and 2 months with an amazing family and took care of their four children (ages 4 months, 2yo , 4yo and 6yo when I stared) while taking classes at NCC then I moved and stayed for 1 year with another family with two children (ages 10 months and 5yo when I stared) . The next family I worked with them for almost 3 years, the kid was 4 months when I started! My most recent family I've been working with them for almost 2 years! I have experience with ages newborn to 5th Grad. I am a responsible, hard worker, reliable and punctual person, and also adapt easily into new routines.

She is always promptly on time and never last minute calls out of work. Even if she feels under the weather she shows up to support me. She is also extremely trustworthy. I can always count on her. \n\nMost importantly, she is phenomenal with my two children (ages 3.5 and 2). She is nurturing, caring and loving, while also creating an environment of mutual respect. She takes the time to coordinate playdates and plan fun activities to do with the kids. They absolutely love her and talk about her after she leaves for the day. \n\nShe goes above and beyond her responsibilities. She sleep trained my daughter when she was 5 months old and also potty trained her when she turned 2. She is beyond patient and dedicated and does it all with a smile on her face. \n\nLarissa is extremely organized, has great communication skills and is incredible at time management. She is also a very cautious/experienced driver, which put me at ease since she would also drive my kids to and from their activities, school and playdates. \n\nLarissa truly feels like a part of our family. Any family would be extremely lucky to have her! ",

I love to read and get my nails done as some small hobbies and hopefully these are small things I can share with the kids I can care for!!",
