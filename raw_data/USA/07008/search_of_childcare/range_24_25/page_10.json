I attend to take a unique approach to the care of children, providing warm and supportive energy, as well as the focus on empowering children to learn and grow. In addition to providing essential help to parents, taking on the responsibility of being an excellent example towards children is what makes becoming a caregiver so great.",

In the past I have babysat for 5 children at once for 2 years, besides many other kids. Another family I cared for had a 2-year-old and a mother who had just given birth. I babysat the newborn the first day back from the hospital. I cared for one reoccurring family on a weekly basis for eight years and now as the kids need less care I am looking to take on a new family. I currently own my own photography business which allows me the flexibility to pick to babysitting as well.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you and being able to give the next family the peace of mind that they have a well qualified babysitter.",
