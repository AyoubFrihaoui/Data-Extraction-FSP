I graduated SUNY Cortland in 2015 with a degree in teaching and have been teaching in the NYC school system for the past 8 years. I just moved to NJ and have left the teaching profession. My last position was as a creative director at a homeschool for children with special needs, where I designed and taught creative classes like cooking, baking, arts and crafts, cardboard architecture, macramé, pillow making and much more! I love working with children of all ages, I am extremely creative, kind and caring. I hope to have the opportunity to get to know your children and have fun with them every day!",

With over a year of experience, I'm dedicated to making a positive impact on the lives of children and supporting families in need of reliable childcare.\n\nMy patient, calm, and friendly nature creates a nurturing environment where children feel safe and supported. I believe in open and honest communication with parents and follow their preferred methods to provide regular updates about their child's day and address any concerns or issues that may arise.\n\nWhen it comes to enforcing household rules, I'm very comfortable establishing and maintaining a structured environment that promotes safety, discipline, and respect. To keep children engaged and entertained, I enjoy playing a variety of games with them, including board games, puzzles, educational games, and technology-based games and apps.",

                    "experienceSummary": "Hello!! I am about the best babysitter that you can find. I am a single, professional woman with a good job but like to make extra money. I have been babysitting since I was 12 years old. Twins, triplets, special needs- you name it. I adapt to all situations and have no problem doing housework, activities, driving or going the extra mile with anything that will work for the child/children and the family. I have excellent references from family, friends, current and previous coworkers and bosses as well as families that I have worked for. Overnights are no problem. I am a chemist by trade but have been doing supply chain management for many years. In my spare time, I study history and spend time with my nieces and nephew. I come from a very close loving family and pass that along to the children that I care for. I have spend many years with families until the children no longer needed a babysitter.",
