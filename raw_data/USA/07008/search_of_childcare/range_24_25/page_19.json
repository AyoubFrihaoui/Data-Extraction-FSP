At the same time I use this experience to becoming my dream of being a Pediatrician. I hope to get the opportunity to cater for child/children and make their young lives very memorable.

I will be working with a wonderful family on Thursdays nights, but the weekends are open! \n\nMy experience teaching has always helped me create bonds with my kiddos, as well as aid with those times we need structure. I have my own vehicle and will happily transport kids where they need to go. I enjoy the outdoors and will be happy to spend time in the park or backyard. I can do bath time and bedtime with the kids as well. I am also happy to help with light housework.",
