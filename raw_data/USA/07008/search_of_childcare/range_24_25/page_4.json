With five years of childcare experience, and 4 years of teaching experience, I'm a reliable and enthusiastic caregiver for up to four children, ranging from newborns to preteens. I prioritize open communication with parents, following their preferred methods and mirroring their household rules.\n\nMy patient and friendly nature creates a calm and welcoming atmosphere for children. I love playing outdoor sports, board games, and educational games that make learning fun. My graduate degree in Education, Red Cross CPR and First Aid training, and prior years of teaching and babysitting experience further enhance my ability to provide a safe and nurturing environment.\n\nI have a car, so transportation isn't an issue, and I'm comfortable around pets. Let's connect to explore how I can support your family's childcare needs.",

I also have experience tutoring/ homework help for Pre-Kindergarten to sixth grade students. I love animals especially rodents, dogs and cats. I'm a non smoker and I have no issues with transportation. I can assist with Light Housekeeping and Cooking/Meal Preparation. I love babysitting and nannying because I'm able to form bonds and connections with each family and child I get the privilege of meeting. With my skills I can ensure that each child I care for will be provided with a safe and loving environment.

My background & passion is in Mental Health & the arts. Right after college, I spent a few years working at Person Centered Care Services in Staten Island as a Direct Support Professional, teaching independent living skills to kids with special needs & developmental disorders. Following this, I was introduced to nannying and have worked with several families. I have a cat & I'm a huge dog lover. I enjoy being on the go & helping others.\n\nWith that being said, it's important to me that I work with a family that practices healthy relational dynamics & prioritizes the mental & emotional well-being of their children. If you have read this far, and feel that I might be a good match for your family, let's talk further.",

Open communication is essential, so I ensure regular updates on your child's day, either through verbal communication at pickup or via text or phone calls, whichever you prefer.\n\nWith my strong belief in consistency and structure, I am very comfortable enforcing household rules to ensure a harmonious and disciplined environment. From outdoor sports to board games and puzzles, I enjoy a wide range of activities that promote both physical and mental development.",
