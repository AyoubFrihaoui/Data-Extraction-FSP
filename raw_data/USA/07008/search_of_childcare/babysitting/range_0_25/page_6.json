My creativity and imagination shine through as I engage them in a variety of games and activities, both educational and fun. I firmly believe in open communication with parents and provide regular updates on their child's day, using their preferred method of communication.\n\nWith a year of experience under my belt, I'm comfortable caring for one child at a time and am happy to assist with tasks such as cooking, light housekeeping, and travel.
