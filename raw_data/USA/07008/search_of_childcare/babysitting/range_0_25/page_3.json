Working with children is a huge passion of mine. My passion for children grew when I was around 8 when my twin cousins were born. From 16 I worked at many daycares and summer camps with family friends. I also intend to open and apply for both a daycare and Charter School once I graduate. \n\nI'm looking for a job that will treat me like family.\n\nI started working with kids when I was 16.\n\nIn my spare time, I like to play volleyball.\n\nOne thing you should know about me is I get very attached once a bond is created, so I'm super sensitive about parting ways lol.\n\nMy skills include the Creative-thinking, compassion, child-development.",

During my time there I was promoted to a team leader where I was in charge of managing other teens. I had the opportunity to go on many professional visits and receive extensive one-on-one coaching and support from the directors and coordinators of the center. After graduating high school I began college and working at a charter school in Jersey City where I became an assistant teacher for 1st and 2nd grade. I also had the opportunity to babysit my former high school math teachers children after school hours and on weekends. Last May I was blessed with my baby girl, being a first time mother has been nothing but great. I have many years of experience with children. I am very patient, loving and reliable. Teaching and being around children is a passion of mine and I look forward to all the nanny opportunities that I will have.",

I truly enjoy engaging with little ones; I find it rewarding to foster connections with them and be apart of their development. I was a volunteer teacher and babysitter ranging from 2 years old to 12 years old at church for four years. Besides this experience, I was also a caregiver for children of elementary ages, infants, and toddlers for two years. I am also a fluent speaker of Portuguese.

She read him a lot of books, took him for walks and talked to him a lot, showing him things around the house and neighborhood. She even wrote a nice letter of tips and tricks for the new nanny, which showed how thoughtful she was. She was happy to take instructions and do things the way we ask. She kept us updated on the app that we use and by sending photos during the day. We appreciated having her help and were sad to see her go. ",
