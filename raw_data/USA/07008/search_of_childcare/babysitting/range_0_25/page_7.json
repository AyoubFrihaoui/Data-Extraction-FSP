I'm a compassionate caregiver with a wealth of experience spanning various age groups, from infants to 15-year-olds, gained through my work at daycares.

Volunteering to represent foster children has further deepened my understanding and empathy for their unique needs. With CPR and first aid certifications, I prioritize safety and well-being in any setting. I excel in creating nurturing environments that foster growth, learning, and inclusivity.

I truly enjoyed my years with the families, I have learned so much life experience working with children and their families. It has made me a kind and very patient person. I truly have a passion for helping where I can. I believe this type of service helps not only the parents but the children as well.
