I am a former tenured teacher who stepped away to raise my family, awaiting the opportunity to return to the classroom and make a difference. I resumed teaching six years ago, as a teacher at the Westfield YMCA for children ages 1 through 3. When observing my classroom you would notice that all the children were engaged and most importantly having fun! I left that position in order to attend Rutgers University and received my Teacher of Students with Disabilities endorsement. This allowed me to secure my current position as a special education social studies teacher. As a successful teacher, I vary my instruction and classroom strategies to most effectively meet the divergent needs of my students. I have also applied these same principles over the last 19 years with my own children because as the mother of three teenagers, I pride myself on being warm, welcoming, enthusiastic, flexible, and attentive. \n\nPlease message me about my summer availability.",

I am currently a Part-Time Graduate student at Montclair State, majoring in Clinical Psychology with a concentration in child and adolescent studies. I've previously worked as an early educator at Kinder-care. I've also worked as a Behavioral Assistant, Youth Mentor, and Youth Counselor with children ages 5-17. Additionally, I currently work with different families on care. com as an ad-hoc sitter. I love what I do and will continue to provide care to children while I pursue my degree. My goal is to gain as much experiences as possible, build relationships with families, and pay my way through graduate school. I'm CPR, AED, and first-aid certified. I'm patient, reliable, caring, and supportive. Moreover, safety, wellness, and education is what I value most. Your child/children will be in great hands. I look forward to working with you. Thank you.",
