At 21 I left my home country ( Brazil ) and moved to the United States to study and work with children as a nanny live-in, I stayed for 1 year and 2 months with an amazing family and took care of their four children (ages 4 months, 2yo , 4yo and 6yo when I stared) while taking classes at NCC then I moved and stayed for 1 year with another family with two children (ages 10 months and 5yo when I stared) . The next family I worked with them for almost 3 years, the kid was 4 months when I started! My most recent family I've been working with them for almost 2 years! I have experience with ages newborn to 5th Grad. I am a responsible, hard worker, reliable and punctual person, and also adapt easily into new routines. I'm looking forward to talking to you and getting to know your family!",

She is always promptly on time and never last minute calls out of work. Even if she feels under the weather she shows up to support me. She is also extremely trustworthy. I can always count on her. \n\nMost importantly, she is phenomenal with my two children (ages 3.5 and 2). She is nurturing, caring and loving, while also creating an environment of mutual respect. She takes the time to coordinate playdates and plan fun activities to do with the kids. They absolutely love her and talk about her after she leaves for the day. \n\nShe goes above and beyond her responsibilities. She sleep trained my daughter when she was 5 months old and also potty trained her when she turned 2. She is beyond patient and dedicated and does it all with a smile on her face. \n\nLarissa is extremely organized, has great communication skills and is incredible at time management. She is also a very cautious/experienced driver, which put me at ease since she would also drive my kids to and from their activities, school and playdates. \n\nLarissa truly feels like a part of our family. Any family would be extremely lucky to have her! ",

I strive to create a safe and nurturing environment where children can reach their full potential. My positive experiences in previous babysitting roles motivated me to become a caregiver.\n\nI'm patient, calm, creative, and highly imaginative, and I have excellent communication skills, ensuring that parents are always informed about their child's day or any issues that arise. I'm also comfortable enforcing household rules and boundaries to ensure a safe and structured environment for the children in my care.\n\nI enjoy playing various games with children, including outdoor sports and physical games, board games, puzzles, and educational games that promote learning. I'm comfortable caring for one child at a time and have experience with children of all ages.",
