I have experience watching kids of all ages, and have grown a passion for working with kids. I currently work part time with a family I have been with since 2021 and watch their 2 children, a boy and a girl ages 9 and 11. Not too long ago, I worked for another family and watched their three young sons, ages 2, 4, and 5 and a half. I also cared for a young baby one summer, aged 6 months and sometimes aided in watching his brothers, aged 3 and 5. In addition to these jobs, I have worked here and there for parents on nights out, errand runs, or any other small one time thing. I have also received certifications in CPR and first aid! I am very comfortable with pets as I have had my own my whole life and also do some pet sitting in my area. I am also happy to help with light housekeeping if needed. If our times align, I would be honored to help you out",

It is for these reasons that I consistently receive outstanding feedback from families I have worked with in the past.\n\nIn the last five years alone, I have done babysitting for a number of families on part time basis and worked as a live-in nanny for two years and live-out nanny for three years with the family I am currently serving. I am a young lady full of talent. I am great at cooking as well as event planning.
