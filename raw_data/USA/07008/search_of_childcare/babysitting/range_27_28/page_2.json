I keep parents informed about their child's day and address any issues that arise through written daily reports, verbal communication, and regular updates. While I prefer a relaxed approach, I'm comfortable enforcing household rules when necessary. I enjoy a variety of games with children, from educational to technology-based. I'm comfortable caring for up to four children, and I have experience with children of all ages. My graduate degree and Spanish fluency further enhance my ability to provide a well-rounded and nurturing environment for the children in my care.",

I have been so impressed by Yaira's approach, and how quickly my daughter got accustomed to her. It's also obvious to us that her learning and development has accelerated since Yaira started watching her. She ensures that the day is filled with a combination of reading, playing, outdoor time and creative activities. \nSecondly, she is a great help to us as parents. She has easily taken any instruction we've given, she is solution oriented, and always curious how she can be more helpful. Also, despite play and fun, the house is always spotless. ",
