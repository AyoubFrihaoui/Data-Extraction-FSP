My experience includes being a nanny for a beautiful family with 3 children ages 4-7 and previously babysitting children ages 2-12. I am currently a full time nanny for a family residing in Westfield, children 7 months and 4 years old! (Baby is now almost 16 months). I also am a part time nanny for a second family in Westfield as well, children 7 months and 4 years old (baby is now 16 months). Babysitting and being with children comes naturally to me as I come from a very large family. I love helping babies learn to walk, reading and helping language development, and sensory/educational play. I love crafts, cooking/baking, playing outdoors, sports, reading, movie nights and overall having a fun time with children! I'm extremely friendly, fun, positive and easy going and most kids I know warm up to me real fast :). \n\nI am open on weekends whether it's an every week schedule or a date night out! I look forward to hearing from you and your family.",

I'm fully COVID-19 vaccinated and boosted, and I hold a CPR certification. My experience ranges from caring for infants as young as 2 months to teenagers up to 15 years old, including those on the autism spectrum. I've also managed overnight care.\n\nI decided to become a caregiver because I find joy in building relationships with children and ensuring their safety. Being part of a family's team brings me immense happiness. I'm excited about the opportunity to meet your little bundle of joy!\n\nIn addition to childcare, I can cook, help with housekeeping, and assist with potty training. I'm flexible and available for various tasks around the house, including last-minute date nights on most occasions.\n\nFeel free to contact me anytime. I look forward to the possibility of working with your family!\n\nBest regards,\nJazmin",

I have experience with adapting age appropriate activities and enjoy finding those nearest to you. I worked full time at an educational childcare facility on the UES and have gained valuable knowledge on child based play for infants and toddlers. I now work full time as a foster care social worker and babysit whenever I have time to do so. I adore kids and animals, if you have pets that is not a problem! I can help with cooking preparation and light housekeeping. I enjoy helping others and can answer any questions about my experience or references.",
