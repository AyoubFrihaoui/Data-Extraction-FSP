I am a very sweet, caring, trustworthy and reliable person. I have a passion for children and I truly enjoy being with them. I have experience with kids ranging from 5 months old to 12 years old. In my current and past jobs I had a variety of duties ranging from changing diapers, feeding, nap time, potty training, to grocery shopping, running errands or pick up/drop offs. I have a lot of fun with the kids I take care of. I enjoy bringing them to the park, going for strolls around the neighborhood or doing a bunch of other outdoor and indoor activities. I am capable of light cooking, cleaning or homework help and I am willing to help out all around. You can rely on me to always be there and treat your child/children as if they were one of my own. I hope to hear from you soon!",

I have 5 years experience being a nanny but my experience with kids started at 14 years old babysitting for my neighbors. I aim to provide a safe, nurturing, and stimulating environment for children of all ages. My passion for working with kids stems from the joy of positively impacting their lives.\n I have a lot of experience managing more than one kid, including twins, kids with special needs and newborns.\nBeyond childcare, I am happy to assist with cooking, meal preparation, carpooling, and light housekeeping.\nAlso available for part time or full time starting March 17\nI would love to schedule a time so we can talk and know each other better. Looking forward for your contact!",

She has been amazing and our kids call her aunt Stacy and miss her so dearly when she leaves. We took the whole family to Key West for her wedding and her husband joins us for dinner occasionally. Stacy is ALWAYS the first person I call when I need help with the kids, we have an ongoing conversation over text as well because she’s part of our family now.
