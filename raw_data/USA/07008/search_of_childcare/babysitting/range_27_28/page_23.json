I believe in providing a safe and nurturing environment where children can learn and grow.\n\nI am comfortable enforcing household rules, following the lead of the parents, and communicating openly with them about their child's day. I use written daily reports, regular updates via text or phone call, and whichever method the parent prefers.\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy playing outdoor sports and physical games, board games and puzzles, and technology-based games and apps with children. I'm also comfortable caring for pets.\n\nI'm confident I can provide a positive and enriching experience for your child. I look forward to getting to know you and your family!",

I'm also comfortable enforcing household rules to ensure a safe and nurturing environment. With 10 years of experience caring for children of all ages, I'm confident in my ability to provide a high-quality childcare experience.\n\nWhen it comes to communicating with parents, I believe in open and regular communication. I provide verbal updates at pickup and send regular text or phone call updates throughout the day. I'm also very comfortable enforcing household rules to ensure a safe and nurturing environment.\n\nMy favorite games to play with children are board games and puzzles, as they promote learning and interaction.",
