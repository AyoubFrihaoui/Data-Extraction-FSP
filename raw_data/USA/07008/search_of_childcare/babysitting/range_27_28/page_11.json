I believe in open communication with parents and prefer to discuss any issues at the end of the day to minimize worries. However, in urgent situations, parents would be notified immediately.\n\nI am very comfortable enforcing household rules and enjoy playing both educational games that promote learning and outdoor physical activities.

My diverse language skills, including English and Spanish, allow me to connect with children from different backgrounds and cultures. \nI enjoy providing children the environment of mental stimulation, creative play in crafts, out door exercise, such a soccer (I played sports for years), & self expression through their own comforts. \nI have lived here for two years now making fun summer memories for the kids like I had with my childhood nanny. I hope to provide your family with a short or long term break. \nMy beleif in open communication helps maint a strong partnerships with parents. I provide regular updates on your child's day and always available to address any concerns. My approach to enforcing household rules is guided by the parents' lead, with respect for your family's values.",
