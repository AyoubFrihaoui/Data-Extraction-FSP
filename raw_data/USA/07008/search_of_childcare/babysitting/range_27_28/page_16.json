I strive to provide a safe, nurturing, and stimulating environment for your little ones. I'm known for my patience, creativity, and friendly nature, making me an approachable caregiver for both children and parents.\n\nI believe in open and honest communication with parents. I provide regular updates on your child's day, whether it's through verbal communication at pickup, text messages, or phone calls. I respect the parents' preferred communication method and follow their lead when it comes to enforcing household rules. My favorite activities to engage in with children are educational games that foster learning. I am currently located in Union, NJ. I am a full time stay at home mom to my 10-month-old daughter. I am looking to work with local working families who need childcare services while they are away at work.",

I've gained valuable experience caring for children of various ages, and I'm comfortable looking after up to many children at a time, due to experiences as a teacher. I prioritize open communication with parents. I believe in providing regular updates about their child's day and promptly addressing any concerns or issues that arise, using the parents' preferred communication method. I'm also very comfortable enforcing household rules and ensuring a safe and structured environment for the children in my care.\n\nMy approach to childcare is centered around creativity and imagination. I enjoy engaging children in outdoor sports and physical games, as well as board games and puzzles.",
