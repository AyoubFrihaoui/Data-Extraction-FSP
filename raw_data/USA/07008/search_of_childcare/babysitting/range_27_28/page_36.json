I worked primarily with children from infancy to primary age (about 6/7 years old). But I love all ages! I'm Adult and Pediatric CPR, AED, and First Aid certified by the Red Cross. My college degree is Early Childhood Education/Family Studies and I'm also a certified parent educator and passed the INA Nanny Basic Skills Assessment. I'm also a mama to a sweet 3-year-old little boy! \n\nI love to stay active so I'm hoping to work with a family who loves adventures and the outdoors. I also love arts and crafts (and do many Waldorf based activities), reading, and baking. I love working with children and seeing them blossom into their own person. My background in Montessori has taught me great respect for children and their abilities and therefore I think children should have their needs met and their voices heard.",

Open communication with parents is essential, so I offer verbal updates at pickup and regular text or phone call updates throughout the day to ensure everyone is on the same page. I have no qualms about enforcing household rules to maintain a structured and harmonious home.\n\nFrom outdoor sports and physical games to educational games and technology-based apps, I have a diverse range of activities up my sleeve to keep the kids engaged and entertained.
