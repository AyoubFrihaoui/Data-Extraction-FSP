These children have ranged from 6 months to 12 years of age.\nI have also worked as a mother's helper to a family with a special needs child. During that time I looked over a 7-year-old boy with autism while his parents were busy, attended doctor's appointments, speech therapy sessions, and performed arts and crafts activities with the child. \nI am a graduate of the SUNY New Paltz Speech-Pathology department with a minor in linguistics. Upon my graduation, I was offered a position working as a teacher's assistant at a university in Spain. In addition to working at the university, I taught private tutor sessions to children ranging from 6 years of age to 16. I also looked over these children when their parents were unable to do so. I will be starting a master's degree at Long Island University in September of this year. I will still be able to work during that time. \nI am a very responsible, fun-loving, flexible individual.

I have many great references and I am CPR certified which I did have to use for a 10-month-old that was choking which was a scary experience but all my training paid off because I was able to save her. I started working when I was 15 at a daycare and I have worked in childcare ever since which is my passion! I went to college and completed an associates degree but realized my passion is to work with children so I have stayed with care. com ever since. I have experience with children from age 2 weeks - 13 years old. I also have 3 small nieces that are my absolute everything they are 2, 4, and 6. I have been subbing recently but I'm looking for a more full time position. I look forward to chatting more about what you are looking for!",
