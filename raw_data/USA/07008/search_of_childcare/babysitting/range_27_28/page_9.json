Some key take-aways for me were i) caring and nurturing, ii) communication, and iii) punctuality.  \n\nFirst of all, Imani was such a loving and caring nanny for our now 7-month son.  The amount of smiles that he had each and every day with Imani were priceless.  She did a great job not only learning his routines, but also all of the queues that change over time and as he developed in his own special way.  I sincerely hope to stay connected with Imani and to continue having her be a part of our son's life as he continues to grow.\n\nSecond, her communication was top tier.  For me with a work schedule, it was great to be able to communicate with Imani throughout the day with updates.  I know she also sent many intraday fun pictures to my wife with all of the activities, walks and smiles!\n\nFinally, her professionalism and punctuality.  With us having very active lives, having consistency, punctuality and flexibility is key.  This was table stakes, and Imani never caused us to question this for a single moment.\n\nImani was a gift, and I could not recommend her high enough.  She was a fantastic caregiver to our son, and a pleasure to work with from the parent perspective.",

                    "experienceSummary": "Hi everyone! Teaching and caring for children is both my passion and my purpose. Working as an Elementary School Teacher for the past 7 years, plus over 10 years of childcare experience has opened my eyes and heart to children's needs-- academically, socially, and emotionally. \n\nI absolutely love what I do and wish to broaden its impact through tutoring and childcare. I also hope to use my passion to help families establish normalcy during this uncertain time by providing individualized care and/or instruction. \n\nSome of my favorite tutoring subjects and activities include reading comprehension, writing, math, science, social studies, organization, study habits, and test-taking preparation.\n\nIn childcare positions, I love arts & crafts, exploring nature, games, imaginative play/theatre, building, developing communication skills, and working on whatever goals the parents have set for their child(ren). \n\nHope to hear from you soon!\nCorinne",

Her nurturing and caring nature has made a profound impact on our family, and we are incredibly grateful for the time she has spent with us. From the beginning, Corrine demonstrated a deep commitment to our daughter’s well-being and development. She collaborated with us to create and implement monthly curriculum and provided thorough, insightful reports on our daughter's progress. Her support extended beyond childcare; she helped with housekeeping and took initiative to ease our workload. Her suggestions regarding meal planning, as well as her creative ideas for activities like arts and crafts, water play, and outings to the park, library, and neighborhood walks, were greatly appreciated. Her Montessori-inspired approach to fostering our daughter’s development and independence transformed our space into a mini classroom, offering a limitless learning experience. Corrine has provided exceptional care and support, and we highly recommend her to any family looking for someone dedicated and skilled. ",
