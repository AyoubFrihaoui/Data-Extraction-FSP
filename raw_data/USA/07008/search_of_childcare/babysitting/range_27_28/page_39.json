I have helped with the child care of my friends and family. Especially children with special needs, I have a little brother who has autism and experiences seizers. Also I have a 3-year-old nephew with down syndrome that I adore. Besides family, I've tutored and help take care of children in local areas and I love to engage with them and look for the best methods to teach them and help them study. I wanted to join care because I want to become more involved with child care and I'm currently pregnant and I looking forward to having a child of my own. I cook, clean, I like doing fun activities like art, and I can assist with homework if needed. I have a lot of patience and I just care bout the Childs well being because they are the future. I have references I can provide if needed.",
