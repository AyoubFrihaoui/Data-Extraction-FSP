Being a skilled swimmer myself, I would be thrilled to teach your children how to swim! Throughout my career, I've been entrusted to care for up to three children of various ages, ranging from infants to preteens.\n\nMy calm and patient nature, coupled with my creative and imaginative approach, has helped me connect with children and make their days fun and educational. I keep parents updated on their child's day and any issues that arise through regular verbal communication at pick-up and updates via text or phone call, whichever they prefer.\n\nWhen it comes to household rules, I'm very comfortable enforcing them, ensuring a safe and structured environment for the children in my care. In terms of activities, I enjoy engaging children in outdoor sports, board games, puzzles, and technology-based games and apps.",
