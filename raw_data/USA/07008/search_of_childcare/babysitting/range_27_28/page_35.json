I volunteered at a daycare to gain more experience and am currently taking classes to become a postpartum doula. I plan to go back to school to become a midwife.\n\nI thrive in busy, challenging environments and excel at planning and maintaining schedules. I tutored kids aged 6-13 for a year, so I'm skilled at helping with homework and fostering a love for learning. I'm also CPR certified, ensuring I can handle emergencies.\n\nIn my spare time, I enjoy painting and long walks to de-stress. Babysitting offers me the flexibility I need as I pursue my nursing career.\n\nChoosing me means choosing a dedicated, experienced, and reliable caregiver who is committed to your children's well-being. Thank you for considering me!",
