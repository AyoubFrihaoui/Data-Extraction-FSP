I enjoy spending my time with children. I have participated in child development classes throughout my highschool years where I have gained college credits. Later on I began to work in a daycare for about 3 years. That's when I started to be an assistant teacher and later was promoted to become a lead teacher. I very much enjoyed my time as a teacher in the daycare and many of the students were sad when it was time to go and move on to my next chapter in life, but while I was teaching I also babysat some students in my class. Me and the kids would do fun and safe activities at home while the parents were out working/running errands. I'd like to think of myself as outgoing, adventurous and compassionate. Whenever I get the pleasure to be in the care of your child/children I will always make sure to put their safety first!!",

I've worked with kids of all ages K-12 and Freshman-Sophomores in college. All experiences rewarding and at times challenging. But, I'm honored to have had a hand in their development.\n\nIn my spare time, I like to read, learn new languages, create pottery, journal, move my body (walking, yoga, dance), sing, cook, and spending time with my loved ones.\n\nOne thing you should know about me is that I am a family oriented person.

I would also babysit on the weekends for a family who had a son with special needs. I helped with all of the above and made sure he recieved all of his medication. I also have experience watching my younger sister and younger cousins. I am a certified nursing assistant, have been working in the hospital for a year. I am majoring in nursing wanting to be a RN for pediatrics. I enjoy working with kids and helping them in any way I could. I still continue to have exprience with children babysitting",

Being a tiny 30-year-old, the kids I take care of think of me as one of them. I love everything art-related and everything is art to me. Along with being a Graphic Design major, I am also a photographer. I absolutely love kids and I enjoy taking care of them. I really don't see it as a job because I have a good time doing it. My child care style is pretty easy going. I like to form a bond with the children and have fun. I have babysat for many families but one I have worked for 8 years. I have stayed over their house, gone on vacations with and assisted with family parties. I have also gotten child ready for school and gotten him off the bus on many occasions. I have experience with multiples as well as infants. I am also CPR certified!",
