I'm Michelle, a passionate childcare professional with experience in various roles, such as babysitter, paraprofessional in a classroom preschool and volunteer work with toddlers. I have a bachelor's degree in Communications from Kean University, as well as a Nanny Certificate and CPR/First Aid certification. I'm a family-oriented person and a pet lover! My hobbies are hiking and painting. Working with children brings me immense joy and fulfillment. I love creating a stimulating learning environment through engaging activities like arts & crafts, make believe play, scavenger hunts, reading books, and other fun age-appropriate games. As a bilingual individual (English and Spanish), I incorporate Spanish into daily routines to help children learn a second language. Safety, emotional support, and teaching essential life skills are my priorities in childcare. I would describe myself as nurturing, responsible, self-sufficient and fun.",
