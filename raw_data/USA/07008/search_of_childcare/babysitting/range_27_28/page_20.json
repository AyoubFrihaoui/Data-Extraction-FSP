I have over 4 years of experience in childcare, and I have taken care of newborns and children up to 12-year-old. I love being around and interact with kids, and as a nanny I try to provide the safest, caring, nurturing and appropriately stimulating environment for the little ones. I also think it's important to help the child thrive and develop their abilities to be creative and social. \n\nI'm an upbeat person, very energetic and with a warm heart. I love giving lots of hugs and words of encouragement. I have the gift of unending patience and I will always try to help the kid communicate their feelings and needs. In addition, I am fully COVID-19 vaccinated and boosted and I am a non-smoker.\n\nI have amazing references. Please reach out if you're looking for a great and loving nanny like me so we can talk more about your needs and my work experience.\n\nHope to hear from you soon!!",
