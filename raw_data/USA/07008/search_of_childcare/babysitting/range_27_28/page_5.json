I believe open and honest communication is key, so I'll keep parents updated about their child's day and any issues that arise.\n\nI'm very comfortable enforcing household rules, and I love playing all sorts of games with children, including outdoor sports, board games, and educational games. I'm also happy to help with cooking, meal preparation, light housekeeping, and swimming supervision.\n\nI'm available to care for up to three children of any age group.

My daughter is at Wesleyan University playing lacrosse (proud mom) and my son is a senior in high school, committed to play lacrosse at St. Lawrence. I am also a former Westfield special education teacher and I provided early intervention for many years. I have been providing child care for newborns and up for over 15 years locally. In the last few years I have also taken on the role as house manager for several families. I have been fortunate to stay with the same families for years at a time and have the best working relationships with all of them. I am working part time now with 2 families so I only have part time hours available but can fill those with the right family. Feel free to contact me with your needs. Thanks!",

I have a Bachelors of Science in Music and I have a very unique experience teaching that can be a great asset for your family this year. Not only have I been teaching private music lessons for about 20 years (both in person and remotely) but I have also been teaching children from ages 3-18 in some capacity or another for nearly 20 years. Other than a regular classroom setting where children are grouped by grade and age, I also have experience working with multiple children of varying ages and levels at the same time. Due to the Pandemic, I worked at a REC center this past Spring where each teacher had a classroom full of children of all different ages (K-5th grade). The combination of distance learning and the physical classroom gave me many unique tools to use so I can teach and enrich children's lives while keeping them safe and healthy.",
