The task I am capable of is quite varied, It includes serving children with nutritious meals, and entertaining them, doing laundry and light cleaning. I also have the ability to teach a couple of simple things such as reading, writing or foreign languages, and also help with homework. I'm very energetic and enjoy playing with kids. I also have experience with children with special needs and have worked with a Type 1 diabetic kid (6 years old) for 4 years. On top of all these, I am happy to work with children.

My previous babysitting roles solidified my desire to make a positive impact on their lives. I'm patient, creative, and approachable, ensuring a supportive environment for your child.\n\nCommunication is key. I provide written daily reports, have verbal communication at pickup, and give regular updates via text or phone call. I'm also very comfortable enforcing household rules to ensure a structured and safe environment.\n\nWith outdoor sports, board games, puzzles, and educational games, I love playing a variety of games that promote physical activity and learning. I'm comfortable caring for one child at a time and have experience with special needs children. As a certified teacher with early child development coursework and training in First Aid and CPR, I'm well-equipped to provide the best care for your child.",
