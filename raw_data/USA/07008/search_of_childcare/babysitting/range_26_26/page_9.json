I have a younger sister, as well, so I am constantly around children. I am very organized, responsible, and energetic. I love to create fun and exciting activities for children to do, as seeing a smile on a someone's face brings me such joy. I have a background of babysitting children of all ages, infants to young teens, both male and female. During my time babysitting, I have been responsible for tutoring, driving children around, preparing food, and creating a fun and safe environment. Additionally, as part of my studies in high school I took a course called Tomorrow's Teachers, which gave me the opportunity to work with many different students, ranging from first to sixth grade. I am a recent college graduate with an accounting degree. On campus I was involved in a club that focuses on aiding battered women and their children, which I very involved in.",

I truly enjoy creating fun, engaging, and safe environments where kids can learn, play, and feel comfortable.\n\nSome of my favorite hobbies include painting, reading, dancing, playing sports, listening to music, and exploring technology.
