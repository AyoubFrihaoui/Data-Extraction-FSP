My friendly and approachable nature allows me to build strong relationships with both children and parents. I believe open communication is key, so I ensure regular updates and follow the parents' preferred communication method to keep them informed about their child's day or any issues that arise.\n\nWith two years of experience and a deep understanding of child development, I am comfortable caring for children of all ages, from infants to preteens.
