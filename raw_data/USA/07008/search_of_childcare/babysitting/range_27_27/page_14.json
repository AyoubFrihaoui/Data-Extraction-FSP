Later on I began to work in a daycare for about 3 years. That's when I started to be an assistant teacher and later was promoted to become a lead teacher. I very much enjoyed my time as a teacher in the daycare and many of the students were sad when it was time to go and move on to my next chapter in life, but while I was teaching I also babysat some students in my class. Me and the kids would do fun and safe activities at home while the parents were out working/running errands. I'd like to think of myself as outgoing, adventurous and compassionate. Whenever I get the pleasure to be in the care of your child/children I will always make sure to put their safety first!!",

I have a background child psych and have obtained my applied behavioral analysis certificate which has allowed me the opportunity to work with children on the spectrum. I am also certified in basic life support which includes CPR. \n\nI have a double bachelors (bio and psych) and a masters in neuroscience. Prior to my medical career, I worked as a professor as well as an ABA therapist. \n\nPrior to my medical career I was a competitive dancer and enjoyed other forms of art. Therefore, I am a perfect choice for creative families who enjoy doing crafts, or families who prefer to limit screen time.\n\n**Please note that I will be returning to school in July**\n\n Please contact me with any additional questions!",
