I've worked with kids of all ages K-12 and Freshman-Sophomores in college. All experiences rewarding and at times challenging. But, I'm honored to have had a hand in their development.\n\nIn my spare time, I like to read, learn new languages, create pottery, journal, move my body (walking, yoga, dance), sing, cook, and spending time with my loved ones.\n\nOne thing you should know about me is that I am a family oriented person.
