With three years of experience, I'm skilled at caring for children of all ages, from infants to preteens. My patient and calm demeanor allows me to handle challenging situations with ease. I believe in clear communication with parents, keeping them informed about their child's day and any issues that arise. I follow the parents' preferred communication method. While I follow the parents' lead on household rules, I strive to create a safe and nurturing environment for children. I love playing outdoor sports and physical games, as well as educational games that promote learning. Additionally, I'm certified in CPR and First Aid. I'm excited about the opportunity to bring joy and make a positive impact on the lives of children and their families.",

This has lead to me nannying for various additional families throughout the years. I have experience working for a vet as well, which helped me care for those families animals also. I am looking for a part-time or full-time job that will be enjoyable and fulfilling! I am fun loving, but responsible. I absolutely love to aid in creative expression through arts & crafts, music, and movement. I'm a big fan of nature and the outdoors, so I'm happy to play outside! And with a background in teaching yoga and meditation, I aim to incorporate a calmer approach to helping children learn and grow.",
