With five years of experience, I am skilled at caring for children of various ages, from infants to preteens. I have a college degree, am CPR and First Aid certified, and have my own car.\n\nMy calm and imaginative nature allows me to connect with children and create a nurturing environment. I believe open communication is key, so I keep parents informed about their child's day and any concerns that arise, using their preferred method of communication.\n\nI am confident in enforcing household rules and promoting good behavior. I enjoy playing a variety of games with children, including outdoor activities, board games, and educational games. I am also comfortable caring for multiple children at once, up to three at a time.\n\nI am fluent in both Arabic and English. In my free time, I enjoy staying active and exploring new places.",
