I am passionate about family values and spending time with children giving them undivided attention. \n\nI am open to a nanny setting where I come in the house care for children, help with cooking, cleaning, prepping for school or sports or anything that is going on.

I'm a creative and friendly individual who believes in open communication with parents. Daily written reports, verbal communication at pickup, and regular text or phone call updates are my preferred methods.\n\nI'm very comfortable enforcing household rules and enjoy playing a variety of games with children, including outdoor sports, board games, and educational games. I'm comfortable caring for up to two children, ranging from infants to pre-teens. Although I have some college education, my skills and experience speak for themselves, and I've completed CPR training.\n\nOn a personal note, I don't have a car but I have reliable transportation , am comfortable with pets, and am more than willing to help with cooking and light housekeeping.",
