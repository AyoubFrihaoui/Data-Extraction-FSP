At first our boy was clingy and upset to be left with someone new, but by the end of her time with us he was very excited to see her when she arrived. She read him a lot of books, took him for walks and talked to him a lot, showing him things around the house and neighborhood. She even wrote a nice letter of tips and tricks for the new nanny, which showed how thoughtful she was. She was happy to take instructions and do things the way we ask. She kept us updated on the app that we use and by sending photos during the day. We appreciated having her help and were sad to see her go. ",

During my time there I was promoted to a team leader where I was in charge of managing other teens. I had the opportunity to go on many professional visits and receive extensive one-on-one coaching and support from the directors and coordinators of the center. After graduating high school I began college and working at a charter school in Jersey City where I became an assistant teacher for 1st and 2nd grade. I also had the opportunity to babysit my former high school math teachers children after school hours and on weekends. Last May I was blessed with my baby girl, being a first time mother has been nothing but great. I have many years of experience with children. I am very patient, loving and reliable. Teaching and being around children is a passion of mine and I look forward to all the nanny opportunities that I will have.",
