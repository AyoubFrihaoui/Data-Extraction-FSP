I am a very reliable, responsible, patient, and creative person who has approximately 4 years of experience caring for children, from infants to teenagers, I have been an au pair for 2 years, worked in day care for about a year and 5 months. With me, your children will receive appropriate care, and I'm willing to do additional other tasks if requested. Personally, I'm an organizer, planner, and multitasker, so minimum supervision is required. With all my skills and experience, I'm able to provide a supervised, safe, and stable environment for your little ones.

I have over 3 years of experience in customer service, the food industry, and working with children aged 6months and up. I'm a patient and attentive worker who can multitask and thrive in a fast-paced work environment. Additionally, I'm highly skilled in cashiering and fluent in Spanish. I'm also fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Previously from Monday to Friday, I facilitated hands-on activities with twin boys, which involved coloring, puzzles, reading, and other engaging tasks. Although the boys spoke English, their parents requested that I communicate with them in Spanish. I helped them improve their proficiency in both languages while also providing minor housekeeping services such as laundry.",
