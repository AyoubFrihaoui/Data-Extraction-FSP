I would like to start putting more funds towards paying off my student loan debt so working a part time job will be helpful. I graduated from the University of Miami in 2018 and since then, I have worked in the energy industry as a Project Engineer. Due to my career, I have sharp interpersonal, STEM, and communication skills. My experience is with 8-year-old and 13-year-old child care for 3 years. In addition, I have been a very active helping hand for my siblings by assisting in child care for my nieces/nephews. I have always loved the idea of working with children and being a positive, guiding element of someone's childhood. I believe through tutoring or a care position, I can do that. I am open to various opportunities so please feel free to reach out to me and ask any questions you would like. Looking forward to connecting!",
