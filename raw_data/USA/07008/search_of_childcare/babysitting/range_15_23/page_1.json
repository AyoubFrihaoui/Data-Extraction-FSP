Working with children is a huge passion of mine. My passion for children grew when I was around 8 when my twin cousins were born. From 16 I worked at many daycares and summer camps with family friends. I also intend to open and apply for both a daycare and Charter School once I graduate. \n\nI'm looking for a job that will treat me like family.\n\nI started working with kids when I was 16.\n\nIn my spare time, I like to play volleyball.\n\nOne thing you should know about me is I get very attached once a bond is created, so I'm super sensitive about parting ways lol.\n\nMy skills include the Creative-thinking, compassion, child-development.",
