My creativity and imagination allow me to engage children in fun and educational activities that promote their learning and development. I'm also friendly and approachable, which makes it easy for children and parents to communicate with me.\n\nWhen it comes to communicating with parents, I believe in open and honest communication.

I have custody of three children for about four years, 1 niece and 2 nephews, 1 has ADHD, but I have raised them since they were babies. I cook well, I clean well, and I love reading bedtime stories and singing, playing and dancing with children. Children are never to young to learn, that's why I love to implement age appropriate arts and crafts, or any other learning ideas that are fun and exciting. When children smile and laugh it brings complete joy to my heart knowing that I'm bringing joy to theirs. I am a quick learner, so whatever I can't do I can learn with no problems. I love to converse and share past stories and future goals. I love to help inspire, motivate, teach, and encourage children of all ages. Anything else I will be pleased to share.

My friendly and patient nature allows me to connect easily with children, creating a safe and nurturing environment. I keep parents informed throughout the day, using written reports and verbal communication at pickup, adhering to their preferred method of contact. Enforcing household rules comes naturally to me, ensuring a consistent and structured environment for the children in my care. From outdoor adventures to educational games, I enjoy a variety of activities that engage children and promote their learning and growth.

I'm comfortable enforcing household rules and communicating with parents about their child's day or any issues that arise. I believe in open and honest communication and will always keep parents informed about their child's well-being.\n\nI enjoy playing a variety of games with children, including board games, puzzles, and outdoor activities. I have had one knee replacement and have some age-related arthritis, so I would prefer working with younger children, rather than older ones. \nI have some high school education, but I do not speak English and am most comfortable speaking in Hindi and Gujarati.",

I started babysitting at 16 years old for 2 families to help them when their kids came home after school. I have experience with all ages groups and I'm also great with pets. I can help with light house work, vacuuming, laundry, dishes etc. I can also provide you with feed back from families that I have worked for, they will let you know I'm extremely reliable, responsible, fun and I can also think outside of the box to keep your children entertained! I speak three languages, English, Portuguese, and Spanish. If you think I will suite your needs please do not hesitate to contact me! Can't wait to hear from you, have a great day!!",
