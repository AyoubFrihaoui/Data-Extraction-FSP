I will be receiving my bachelors degree in Social Work, May of 2023, and I am looking for a nanny job to support me along the way!\n\nI am very passionate about working with youth and families! Since the age of 16, I have worked in day care centers and elementary schools. Throughout my professional and academic journey, I have expanded my experience to working with middle school & high school aged children. Outside of my professional experience, I am the youngest of 7 children and I have many nieces and nephews.

When getting my bachelor I worked for one family just watching their two children after school. Once summer hit they went to camp, they were also pretty big so they only needed me for the year. For the rest of my bachelor I worked with two boys in Westfield that I loved. After them I started working in day cares with babies and young children which are my favorite. Once Covid hit I choose to go back to school online and become a full time nanny Now I have my own baby. I'm looking for a family that will let me watch their child with my own child. He is 3 months old and super easy going. I have a lot of experience handing many children at once, so I believe I would be able to give mine and your what they need.",
