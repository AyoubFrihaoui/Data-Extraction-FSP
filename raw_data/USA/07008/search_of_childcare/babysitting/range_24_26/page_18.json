Additionally I am free on weekends to provide childcare for a family that needs it. \nI am patient, dedicated, and caring, as well as determined to make a positive impact on any child and family I am more than willing to assist in online schooling, homework, or tutoring.

I truly enjoy watching children. I like to keep them occupied with their homework, playing games, painting/coloring, and also by spending time outdoors. I am very caring, compassionate, patient, and energetic. I love coming up with new interactive games to play with children whether inside or outside. Some things that I have experience with is pick up/drop offs from school, taking children to doctor appointments, driving children to sports practice, children meal prep, running errands, helping out with pets, nap time/bed time, and also bath time. I also have excellent references from 5+ families.",
