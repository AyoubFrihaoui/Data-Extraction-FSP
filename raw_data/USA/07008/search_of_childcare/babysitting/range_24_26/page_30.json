I grew up in Trenton NJ but have seen many parts of the world thanks to the great families I had the opportunity to work with. Honestly I had an affinity for children at a early age. I loved babysitting my nieces and nephews when I was a teen, especially during the summer. I'm proud to say that this made me realize later in life that I enjoy working with juveniles. Nannying influenced my career choice for school which is a duel major in early childhood education and law enforcement. Thanks to my schooling and experience with all ages I can always invent creative and fun games. I find that children have always connected to my personality and my exciting spirit. I love being a nanny; it is the most rewarding and fulfilling job out there. Children are a delightful gift: they bring so much joy to my heart and make everyday so much better.",

In 2002 after my son was born I worked at our church as an aftercare teacher working with pre-k up to 8th grade . I loved the interaction with all of the kids but then I moved and had to leave that job . A very dear friend of mine reached out to me in need of a nanny for her 8-month-old daughter in July of 2018 I began taking care of her . Teaching her ABC's , numbers, colors , songs and etc. Unfortunately I had to leave in March of 2020 due to Covid . I miss taking care of kids watching them laugh , smile , learn and grow . I'm a big kid at heart myself .",

I will be working with a wonderful family on Thursdays nights, but the weekends are open! \n\nMy experience teaching has always helped me create bonds with my kiddos, as well as aid with those times we need structure. I have my own vehicle and will happily transport kids where they need to go. I enjoy the outdoors and will be happy to spend time in the park or backyard. I can do bath time and bedtime with the kids as well. I am also happy to help with light housework.",
