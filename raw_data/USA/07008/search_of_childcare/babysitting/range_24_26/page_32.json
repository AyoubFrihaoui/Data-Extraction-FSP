                    "experienceSummary": "Hi, my name is Valerie, and my passion in life is working with children. I have been working with children since I was 14 years old and have watched and work with children as young as three months and throughout high school age. I graduated SUNY Cortland in 2015 with a degree in teaching and have been teaching in the NYC school system for the past 8 years. I just moved to NJ and have left the teaching profession. My last position was as a creative director at a homeschool for children with special needs, where I designed and taught creative classes like cooking, baking, arts and crafts, cardboard architecture, macramé, pillow making and much more! I love working with children of all ages, I am extremely creative, kind and caring. I hope to have the opportunity to get to know your children and have fun with them every day!",

I am passionate about children because you can learn a lot from them, like how to enjoy the simple things in life. I have been working with children for the past 5 years in the position of babysitters, nanny and daycare assistant. I have worked with all ages from newborn to 15 years old. I love working with children and getting to know them and their individual personalities. Interactive choices and empowering others to be confident in their own freewill while still being respectful and honoring of those around them is key & helping them as they grow and face new challenges in school and life in general. I have worked with children in several different countries through relief work and various mission trips. I have a passion for childcare that I can not ignore. kids are simply my favorite to be around never a dull moment.",
