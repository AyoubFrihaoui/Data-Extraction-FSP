I am a former tenured teacher who stepped away to raise my family, awaiting the opportunity to return to the classroom and make a difference. I resumed teaching six years ago, as a teacher at the Westfield YMCA for children ages 1 through 3. When observing my classroom you would notice that all the children were engaged and most importantly having fun! I left that position in order to attend Rutgers University and received my Teacher of Students with Disabilities endorsement. This allowed me to secure my current position as a special education social studies teacher. As a successful teacher, I vary my instruction and classroom strategies to most effectively meet the divergent needs of my students. I have also applied these same principles over the last 19 years with my own children because as the mother of three teenagers, I pride myself on being warm, welcoming, enthusiastic, flexible, and attentive. \n\nPlease message me about my summer availability.",
