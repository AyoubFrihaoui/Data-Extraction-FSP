I'm offering child care and household services. I love being a baby sitter, I love being able to help children. I have experience working with newborns, infants, toddlers and older children as well. I've been watching children since I was about 15 years old. My responsibilities have included helping with homework, doing arts and crafts and even some play time.\nI was once a paraprofessional, I was working with children with disabilities all ages. So that's a plus. I also was a teacher assistant with children age 2\nI'm very good at cooking, cleaning and even running errands as well. I've been a caretaker before, I was working with a young girl for some time. I've also had experience with senior care, I helped out my grandmother for sometime. I ran errands for her, cook for her.\nI'd describe my personality as helpful, loving, caring, happy, energetic",

I am also a member and current captain of the DC Women's Basketball team. I have been working with children from ages birth-13 for about seven years. I have worked countless summer camps with children as well. Last semester I was assigned to work in a daycare with babies from 2-9 months. Asides from babysitting/nannying, I was a second, third, and fourth grade tutor. I am very fun, extremely personable, responsible, and am great at multitasking! Working with children is something I love. I have a passion for looking out for others and caring for babies/children!",

I have worked with children my entire life, from being an assistant instructor at my martial arts dojo, to working at Sunrise Day Camp for three summers! I love babysitting because children bring me joy. Every time you hear them laugh about something, or even when they do something that could be perceived as silly, it brightens your life a little bit more! Other than babysitting, I've also volunteered at the Brooklyn VA hospital, worked with children and adults who have special needs, and tutored Psychopharmacology and History at my Alma mater! I'm also an animal lover! I've had an aquarium for four years, and I'm taking home a poodle puppy in a few weeks!",
