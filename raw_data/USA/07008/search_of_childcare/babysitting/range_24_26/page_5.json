When it comes to childcare, there's so much stress, so it's nice when the person you hire doesn't add to that stress. One time I had her come watch my 2 boys while I tidied the house and ran some errands. I didn't have to explain or prompt her with what to do, like I have had to with other babysitters. She took charge, played with the boys, and they had the best time. We have recently moved. For awhile, we were back & forth between 2 states. We kept our dog in SI for a few weeks, and she was super helpful watching the dog, feeding, walking, etc. I really wish we had found her sooner. She always had a smile, there was never any drama, and the boys loved her. I should also mention that I have a 3 and 5 year old: 2 boys who are very rambunctious. The 5 year old has epilepsy. This is something that was a deterrent to many applicants. I told Liana about his epilepsy, medication, seizures, and what to do, during the interview. She felt confident that she could handle it. In addition, there were days she had to watch the boys from 5:30am-9 or 10pm, and she did so with no issues. I would hire her again in a heartbeat.",

I also do house work; such as clean, laundry, food preparation and pick ups and drops offs. My main purpose is to make life just a little bit easier for you. Anything I can do to make things easier, I am willing to do. I am willing to nanny at your home or at my place. Whichever you are comfortable with. I am looking for something full time and I am willing to provide references. I am COVID Vaccinated and I have the booster. I am CPR certified & have background in early childhood education. I have worked with children who have special needs & have worked with kids from ages 2 weeks to 19 years old! Hopefully I can be the right fit for your family.

I live in Tottenville and I have experience with 16-month-olds to 12-year-old school children. I have cared for high functioning autistic children. I also have experience tutoring/ homework help for Pre-Kindergarten to sixth grade students. I love animals especially rodents, dogs and cats. I'm a non smoker and I have no issues with transportation. I can assist with Light Housekeeping and Cooking/Meal Preparation. I love babysitting and nannying because I'm able to form bonds and connections with each family and child I get the privilege of meeting. With my skills I can ensure that each child I care for will be provided with a safe and loving environment. I'm willing to accommodate to any parenting styles/ lifestyle choices you've established thus far. I hope you consider me to care for your child.",

My background & passion is in Mental Health & the arts. Right after college, I spent a few years working at Person Centered Care Services in Staten Island as a Direct Support Professional, teaching independent living skills to kids with special needs & developmental disorders. Following this, I was introduced to nannying and have worked with several families. I have a cat & I'm a huge dog lover. I enjoy being on the go & helping others.\n\nWith that being said, it's important to me that I work with a family that practices healthy relational dynamics & prioritizes the mental & emotional well-being of their children. If you have read this far, and feel that I might be a good match for your family, let's talk further.",
