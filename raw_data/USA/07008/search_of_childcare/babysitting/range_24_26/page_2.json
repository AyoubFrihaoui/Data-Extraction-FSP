However, I have been working in childcare for almost 2 years and have been enjoying every moment. I currently work full-time with children between the ages of 2-3, while also spending some time with the infants. I am CPR and First Aid certified, keeping safety as a top priority. I have experience in the areas of diaper changing, meal prep, and calm-down and sleep strategies. I am excited to get to know you as well as your little ones and create lasting memories together!\n\nI'd describe my personality as outgoing, adaptable, and uplifting.",
