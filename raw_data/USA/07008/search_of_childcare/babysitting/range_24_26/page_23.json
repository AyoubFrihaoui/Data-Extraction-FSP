I helped them full time with their daily routine like driving them to school and activities, meals, play and laundry.\n\n> Strong swimmer\n> Safe Driver\n> CPR certified\n> First Aid Training\n> Special Needs Childcare\n> Own Transportation\n> Non-Smoker\n> COVID Vaccinated-Booster\n> Flu vaccinated\n\nLet's chat!!",
