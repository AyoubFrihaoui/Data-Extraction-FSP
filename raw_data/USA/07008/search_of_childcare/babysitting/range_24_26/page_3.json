I am currently a Part-Time Graduate student at Montclair State, majoring in Clinical Psychology with a concentration in child and adolescent studies. I've previously worked as an early educator at Kinder-care. I've also worked as a Behavioral Assistant, Youth Mentor, and Youth Counselor with children ages 5-17. Additionally, I currently work with different families on care. com as an ad-hoc sitter. I love what I do and will continue to provide care to children while I pursue my degree. My goal is to gain as much experiences as possible, build relationships with families, and pay my way through graduate school. I'm CPR, AED, and first-aid certified. I'm patient, reliable, caring, and supportive. Moreover, safety, wellness, and education is what I value most. Your child/children will be in great hands. I look forward to working with you. Thank you.",

I have experience watching over children and helping with their needs. In the summer of 2017, I was given a chance to work around children and since then I've spent my summers as a counselor, teacher, and assistant working with different age groups in various environments such as camps and daycares. I have over 7 years of experience. I often travel through the boroughs to try new restaurants, visit new places or go to dance classes so I'm open to babysitting anywhere! I like to spend my free time reading, dancing, cooking, doing yoga and trying new hobbies such as roller skating. I would describe myself as being kind, creative, respectful and adventurous. I'm open to working late and I'm great with pets. I'm looking forward to being an addition to your family and creating a safe place and comfortable atmosphere for your children to thrive in.",
