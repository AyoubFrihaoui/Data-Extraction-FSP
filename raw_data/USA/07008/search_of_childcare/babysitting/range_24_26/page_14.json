As the youngest of 9 in my own family, I became an aunt at 5 years old. My oldest nephew was followed by 25 more nieces and nephews. Many years later I am a great aunt to 34 beautiful children. I am also a mother of 2 adult boys. Aside from my personal experience, I've worked as a preschool teacher since 1998. Over these years, I believe that each and every child I've taught has been a blessing to me. Children are so precious, so gifted, and so special in their unique personalities. It has been my lifelong objective to teach children love, kindness, respect, curiousity for learning and an enthusiasm for everything beautiful their lives have to offer.",

I have a background of babysitting children of all ages, infants to young teens, both male and female. During my time babysitting, I have been responsible for tutoring, driving children around, preparing food, and creating a fun and safe environment. Additionally, as part of my studies in high school I took a course called Tomorrow's Teachers, which gave me the opportunity to work with many different students, ranging from first to sixth grade.
