While I respect the household rules set by the parents, I am also comfortable enforcing them consistently. From engaging in outdoor sports and physical games to playing board games and puzzles, I enjoy a variety of activities that promote learning and fun. As a native English and Spanish speaker, I am comfortable caring for children from diverse backgrounds. I am also willing to assist with light housekeeping tasks.

These last few years I took part in many opportunities where I became an individual who many children looked up to and enjoyed being around. From growing up in a household of 10 to guiding campers to a fun summer, it is my goal to create a robust relationship with both children and parents. I attend to take a unique approach to the care of children, providing warm and supportive energy, as well as the focus on empowering children to learn and grow. In addition to providing essential help to parents, taking on the responsibility of being an excellent example towards children is what makes becoming a caregiver so great.",
