I believe a babysitter / nanny plays an important role in a child's life, I will always treat children as if they were my own. I am always interacting with the child as much as I can and will always have activities and crafts ready to keep things fun and productive. I love reading and singing songs / dancing with the children. I am experienced in homework help as well as teaching younger children their ABC's and 123's in fun and creative ways.
