After that I went on to working with this beautiful family for 3 years until all of their children went to school. I later went on to work as a Assistant Teacher, working with children from 2. 5 years old to 5 years old. I love working with kids of all ages because every age teaches you something new.

I also enjoy creating fun and interactive crafts, such as coloring, and offering mini-crochet lessons. Additionally, I am a 200-hour certified yoga instructor and have been teaching kids yoga for over two years. I am currently enrolled in a 300-hour yoga teacher training at HOME Power Yoga studio in Cranford, NJ, to enhance my knowledge, practice, and career goals related to teaching kids yoga.

I love being able to point out new things to children and watch their face light up because they've learned something new! I'm here to make life a little easier. I do everything pertaining to the children.... Laundry, cleaning/ organizing toys, meals, bath time & other activities. You name it, I can do it! I pride myself on asking questions when I'm confused and communicating with parents so neither one of us are left in the dark about anything!

My background includes a graduate degree and certifications in First Aid and teaching. When it comes to enforcing household rules, I am confident and consistent in ensuring a safe and structured environment for the children in my care.\n\nMy approach to childcare involves open communication with parents, ensuring that I understand their preferences and address any issues promptly. I believe in fostering a nurturing environment where children can learn, play, and grow. I enjoy engaging children in various activities, such as outdoor sports, board games, and educational games that stimulate their minds.\n\nWith a maximum capacity of caring for five children at a time, I am available to assist with tasks like cooking, meal preparation, carpooling, light housekeeping, and supervising swimming activities.",
