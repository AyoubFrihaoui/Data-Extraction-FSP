I'm calm, friendly, and patient, and I prioritize clear communication with parents, updating them daily on their child's day and following their preferred communication method. I enjoy playing educational games that promote learning, as well as board games and puzzles. My skills include cooking, meal preparation, and light housekeeping. I'm happy to care for one child at a time, and I follow the household rules set by the parents. I hope to be the childcare provider for your family.",

Prior to teaching I was a paraprofessional for 7 years. I enjoy working and caring for children. Prior experiences with families includes preparing meal, schedule play dates, assist with homework, and light housekeeping occasionally. \n\nSome of the things I enjoy while caring for children are playing board games, doing arts and crafts, reading and baking. I believe children need time, patience, understanding and I have those qualities to share with a child.",
