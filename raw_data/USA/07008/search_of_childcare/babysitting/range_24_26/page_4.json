I believe in open communication with parents and regularly provide updates on their child's day or any issues that arise. I follow the parents' preferred communication method and respect their lead when it comes to enforcing household rules.\n\nTo keep the children engaged and entertained, I enjoy playing a variety of games with them, including outdoor sports and physical games, as well as educational games that promote learning.

I hold several childcare certifications, including basic life support. As a certified doula, I have a deep understanding of the early stages of child development and the unique needs of both infants and their families. This experience has enriched my approach to childcare, allowing me to create a nurturing environment that fosters growth, creativity, and emotional well-being. In addition to my childcare expertise, I am also an artist. I believe in the power of creativity and self-expression. Whether it's through painting, crafting, or imaginative play, I strive to inspire children to explore their creativity while developing their cognitive and motor skills. I am comfortable with cooking meals, & tidying up. As a pet-friendly individual, I am more than happy to care for furry family members as well.",

I plan to go to nursing school in the spring, but am currently looking for babysitting jobs to help myself finance that, as well as offer my care and help to those who need it. \n\nI've always had a natural knack for working with children, and love to do it. I'm an energetic, caring, young at heart sitter, and love doing arts and craft, playing with dolls or blocks, or even helping with homework. I've had a plethora of jobs where I've worked with kids in different settings, including babysitting, swim lessons, substitute teaching, and ABA. I find immense gratification in working with the youth of our future, and find that kids love me for my fun and silly nature, whilst still being a responsible caregiver. \n\nI'm also fluent in Polish.\n\nOnly one-time or occasional jobs please.\nAvailable after 5 p.m. on weekdays.",
