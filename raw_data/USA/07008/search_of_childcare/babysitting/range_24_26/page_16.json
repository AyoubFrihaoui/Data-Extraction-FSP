I've been baby sitting my family and friends kids starting from a young age, so this is something I'm great at , I have patience , compassion and good communication skills to ensure a positive experience for both the children and their parents. I would be entrusted with the important task of caring for a child's well-being, which requires attention to detail and the ability to stay calm under pressure. I'm very big on cleaning houses, keeping everything neat and organized for when everyone comes home , I like to adventure around and interact with the little ones, I love to paint and draw , being outdoors it's something I enjoy , I'm also a 4th year college student criminal justice major doing this as a little side job until I go back to school , I'm also a hostess Friday through Sunday , I can also speak Spanish (Uruguayan ) overall, if you're interested, we can chat if my hours do not work with you and we can make an arrangement !

I grew up helping take care of children all my life, both in   and outside babysitting jobs. A few years ago I also taught gymnastics to kids of all ages. My favorite activities to engage in with kids are arts and crafts and outside activities. I also have experience taking care of pets. I follow directions well and I help when and where I am needed. I am knowledgeable in many different areas and am capable of providing multiple services. I am available for pet sitting (at your location), house sitting, and babysitting. I have my own vehicle and I don't mind running errands or running your kids around. I am reliable, trustworthy and cheerful, and I have always had positive feedback from employers.",

Since then, I have worked as a caregiver in numerous settings. I have more than 10 years of paid experience as a Nanny.\n I am gifted in developing and implementing quality activities in arts and crafts, fine arts, drama, music, cognitive games, and basic skills in education/homework. I speak fluent English. I possess First Aid and CPR certifications. I have my own car and a clean driving record. It would be my pleasure to help you with any childcare, housekeeping, errands or transportation needs you may have. Also, I am able to travel domestically and internationally on very short notice.\nOn a personal note, I am an avid runner, swimming enthusiast, animal lover, and a pretty good baker.\nI would welcome the opportunity to speak with you about how I could provide the best care for your children and your household.\nThank you for your kind consideration.",
