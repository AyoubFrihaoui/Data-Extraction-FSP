My husband and I interviewed Samantha a few months before our daughter was born.  From the very first meeting we were impressed with her intelligence, certifications and experience. We knew we had met someone very special and needed to hire her right away!  During my maternity leave, Samantha visited often to get to know us and our baby.  This truly helped with my return to work.\r\n\r\nSamantha has been with our family for two years and I can say with confidence, that Samantha has made the utmost impact on our daughter and is part of our family. The love, attention she has given our daughter goes far beyond caring for basic needs.  She nurtures her, guides her and sets examples and boundaries to help her grow.  While we know it is the right time for our daughter to go to school, we will miss Samantha terribly! You and your child will be so lucky to have her!",

I have been babysitting since I was 12 years old. Twins, triplets, special needs- you name it. I adapt to all situations and have no problem doing housework, activities, driving or going the extra mile with anything that will work for the child/children and the family. I have excellent references from family, friends, current and previous coworkers and bosses as well as families that I have worked for. Overnights are no problem. I am a chemist by trade but have been doing supply chain management for many years. In my spare time, I study history and spend time with my nieces and nephew. I come from a very close loving family and pass that along to the children that I care for. I have spend many years with families until the children no longer needed a babysitter.",

At the same time I use this experience to becoming my dream of being a Pediatrician. I hope to get the opportunity to cater for child/children and make their young lives very memorable. I will also be glad if I am given the chance to use my quantities as a caregiver at your workplace. Thank you.",
