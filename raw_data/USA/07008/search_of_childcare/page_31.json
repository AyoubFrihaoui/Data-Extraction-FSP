I have 5 years experience being a nanny but my experience with kids started at 14 years old babysitting for my neighbors. I aim to provide a safe, nurturing, and stimulating environment for children of all ages. My passion for working with kids stems from the joy of positively impacting their lives.\n I have a lot of experience managing more than one kid, including twins, kids with special needs and newborns.\nBeyond childcare, I am happy to assist with cooking, meal preparation, carpooling, and light housekeeping.\nAlso available for part time or full time starting March 17\nI would love to schedule a time so we can talk and know each other better. Looking forward for your contact!",

She has been amazing and our kids call her aunt Stacy and miss her so dearly when she leaves. We took the whole family to Key West for her wedding and her husband joins us for dinner occasionally. Stacy is ALWAYS the first person I call when I need help with the kids, we have an ongoing conversation over text as well because she’s part of our family now.

They are full of life, funny, sassy sometimes, and curious, I love all those things and I also like to teach kids the right and wrong way of things if parents are okay with it, I also know how to take care of them other then play time wise, such as eating/ dinner or snack time, bathing, electronics, certain things you can't touch or get into, I'm very attentive with kids who are younger and with all kids in general. They are amazing human being and they deserve to be with someone who will play toys with them, but also keep them safe until their parents are home.",
