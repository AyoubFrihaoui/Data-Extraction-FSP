I am committed to providing a safe, fun, and nurturing environment for the children in my care. I truly enjoy engaging with little ones; I find it rewarding to foster connections with them and be apart of their development. I was a volunteer teacher and babysitter ranging from 2 years old to 12 years old at church for four years. Besides this experience, I was also a caregiver for children of elementary ages, infants, and toddlers for two years. I am also a fluent speaker of Portuguese. I would love to speak with you personally about your family's needs. Please feel free to contact me. Thank you!",

Im also very caring when it comes to a child's need. I grew up taking care of my baby cousins while their parents are at work and whenever they needed assistance in the house. I have worked with ages 4 months- 4 years old. I'm great with kids and kind. I don't raise my voice or yell I'm very understanding when a kid is upset and do my best to calm them down and cheer them up when upset. I have been babysitting for 3 years now on the app and met a lot of great families.",
