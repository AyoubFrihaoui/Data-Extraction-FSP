Some key take-aways for me were i) caring and nurturing, ii) communication, and iii) punctuality.  \n\nFirst of all, Imani was such a loving and caring nanny for our now 7-month son.  The amount of smiles that he had each and every day with Imani were priceless.  She did a great job not only learning his routines, but also all of the queues that change over time and as he developed in his own special way.  I sincerely hope to stay connected with Imani and to continue having her be a part of our son's life as he continues to grow.\n\nSecond, her communication was top tier.  For me with a work schedule, it was great to be able to communicate with Imani throughout the day with updates.  I know she also sent many intraday fun pictures to my wife with all of the activities, walks and smiles!\n\nFinally, her professionalism and punctuality.  With us having very active lives, having consistency, punctuality and flexibility is key.  This was table stakes, and Imani never caused us to question this for a single moment.\n\nImani was a gift, and I could not recommend her high enough.  She was a fantastic caregiver to our son, and a pleasure to work with from the parent perspective.",

With a friendly and approachable personality, I'm skilled at keeping kids entertained and engaged with educational games, creative activities, and outdoor play. I believe in open and honest communication with parents, providing regular updates and following their preferred communication method. While I prefer a flexible approach to household rules, I'm comfortable setting boundaries and ensuring a safe and nurturing environment. Whether it's teaching your kids to swim or helping them with their homework, I'm dedicated to supporting their individual needs and helping them thrive. Finally, I reiterate that my language is Spanish, but I can get by a bit in English, however it may be an advantage for your children that I can teach them Spanish.",
