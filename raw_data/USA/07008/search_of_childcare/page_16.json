One time I had her come watch my 2 boys while I tidied the house and ran some errands. I didn't have to explain or prompt her with what to do, like I have had to with other babysitters. She took charge, played with the boys, and they had the best time. We have recently moved. For awhile, we were back & forth between 2 states. We kept our dog in SI for a few weeks, and she was super helpful watching the dog, feeding, walking, etc. I really wish we had found her sooner. She always had a smile, there was never any drama, and the boys loved her. I should also mention that I have a 3 and 5 year old: 2 boys who are very rambunctious. The 5 year old has epilepsy. This is something that was a deterrent to many applicants. I told Liana about his epilepsy, medication, seizures, and what to do, during the interview. She felt confident that she could handle it. In addition, there were days she had to watch the boys from 5:30am-9 or 10pm, and she did so with no issues. I would hire her again in a heartbeat.",

Ritch has a background in preschool education, which shows through in her creative techniques, knowledge of conflict resolution, and perfectly equilibrated soft style. \n\nA typical day might involve dancing to the Wiggles, combining arts and crafts and learning the numbers, and a fresh and healthy snack. \n\nWe really bonded, my kids LOVED her, and I recommend her to the highest degree.
