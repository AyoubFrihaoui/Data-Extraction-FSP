As a babysitter, I understand the importance of not only ensuring your child's safety but also contributing to their growth and happiness. I have a solid background in childcare, having babysat for several families over the past 3 years. Through my experience, I've cared for children of all ages, from infants to pre-teens, and have developed a strong understanding of their needs at every stage of development. What sets me apart is my personality. I am patient, compassionate, and highly responsible. My goal is to create a balance between fun and structure, ensuring your child is entertained. If you're looking for a babysitter who is not only responsible but also warm, energetic, and truly enjoys spending time with children, I'd love to help out. I look forward to the opportunity to care for your little ones and create a positive experience for both them and you!",

I'm fully COVID-19 vaccinated and boosted, and I hold a CPR certification. My experience ranges from caring for infants as young as 2 months to teenagers up to 15 years old, including those on the autism spectrum. I've also managed overnight care.\n\nI decided to become a caregiver because I find joy in building relationships with children and ensuring their safety. Being part of a family's team brings me immense happiness. I'm excited about the opportunity to meet your little bundle of joy!\n\nIn addition to childcare, I can cook, help with housekeeping, and assist with potty training. I'm flexible and available for various tasks around the house, including last-minute date nights on most occasions.\n\nFeel free to contact me anytime. I look forward to the possibility of working with your family!\n\nBest regards,\nJazmin",
