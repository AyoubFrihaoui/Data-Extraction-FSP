I am a former tenured teacher who stepped away to raise my family, awaiting the opportunity to return to the classroom and make a difference. I resumed teaching six years ago, as a teacher at the Westfield YMCA for children ages 1 through 3. When observing my classroom you would notice that all the children were engaged and most importantly having fun! I left that position in order to attend Rutgers University and received my Teacher of Students with Disabilities endorsement. This allowed me to secure my current position as a special education social studies teacher. As a successful teacher, I vary my instruction and classroom strategies to most effectively meet the divergent needs of my students. I have also applied these same principles over the last 19 years with my own children because as the mother of three teenagers, I pride myself on being warm, welcoming, enthusiastic, flexible, and attentive. \n\nPlease message me about my summer availability.",

My childcare includes teaching important milestones such as crawling, sitting up, walking, talking, and potty training. Weather permitting, I love to take children outside for walks, park visits, etc.\n\nMy experience includes caring for infants through elementary-aged children, which also includes twins and children with special needs. I provide patience, and loving care for each child's unique needs. I have excellent references from families I provided loving care for.",
