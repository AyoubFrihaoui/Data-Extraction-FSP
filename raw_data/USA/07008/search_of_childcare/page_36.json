My kids are grown now and I want to share my love for children and home making with other people. I believe children should feel safe and loved. They should be encouraged to develop and explore their talents and learn in a fun interactive way. I have also been a substitute teacher and believe in structure that helps children grow. I can assist with cooking, meal preparation, and light housekeeping tasks. To ensure safety, I'm trained in CPR. I enjoy crafting reading cooking games and imaginative play as directed by the child. Get in touch to learn how I can add my 25 + years of child rearing to support your family. Thanks for your interest",
