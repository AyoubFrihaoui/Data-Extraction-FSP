I'm a compassionate caregiver with a wealth of experience spanning various age groups, from infants to 15-year-olds, gained through my work at daycares.

Volunteering to represent foster children has further deepened my understanding and empathy for their unique needs. With CPR and first aid certifications, I prioritize safety and well-being in any setting. I excel in creating nurturing environments that foster growth, learning, and inclusivity.

I love their truthfulness.\n\nI believe time, benefits and even pay rate are negotiable as long as both parties try to be fair.\n\nI started working with kids when I was 17, I used to teach back in Brazil, then came to the US as an Au Pair. I've been a nanny, babysitter, mother's help and I currently have a 8yo boy (who WON'T depend on me during working hours). I currently work for a family and I'm looking for a second job.\n\nIn my spare time, I like to play tennis and enjoy my family.\n\nMy skills include being understanding, following directions and being pro active.\nI have knowledge in gentle parenting and ADHD resources and tools. \n\nI believe in respecting children, leading by example and guiding them through difficult times. I also believe in limits and manners.",
