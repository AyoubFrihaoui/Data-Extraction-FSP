Growing up with 4 younger siblings, I was pretty much my mother's helper with everything. I have been in the child care business for the better side of 20 years working with ages from infant to 20 years old. I was also a preschool teacher for 2years and a ABA para professional for 4 years in NJ. I would love to meet with you to see if we are a great fit for each other.
