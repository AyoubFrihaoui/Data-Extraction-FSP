I graduated college about 2 years ago, and am currently working as a behavior technician for children with autism. I plan to go to nursing school in the spring, but am currently looking for babysitting jobs to help myself finance that, as well as offer my care and help to those who need it. \n\nI've always had a natural knack for working with children, and love to do it. I'm an energetic, caring, young at heart sitter, and love doing arts and craft, playing with dolls or blocks, or even helping with homework. I've had a plethora of jobs where I've worked with kids in different settings, including babysitting, swim lessons, substitute teaching, and ABA. No matter the job, I find immense gratification in working with the youth of our future, and find that kids love me for my fun and silly nature, whilst still being a responsible caregiver. \n\nI'm also fluent in Polish.",

I believe in open and transparent communication with parents and strive to keep them informed about their child's day through verbal updates at pickup, regular text messages, or phone calls, depending on their preferred method. \n\nI am highly comfortable enforcing household rules and ensuring the safety and well-being of children in my care.

Children are the joy of my life , I am currently studying child psychology, so working with children is just another step into furthering my career. I am the oldest of five children, so responsibility is nothing new to me , I have helped raise my siblings from birth until now. I do have a car and never even a speeding or parking ticket on my record. I enjoy children very much , at all ages including babies. I currently go to University. I take my career very serious and believe this would give me great experience and a good opportunity.",
