I'm an experienced and responsible caregiver with over a year of experience working with children of all ages, from infants and toddlers to teens up to 15 years old.\n\nI'm a native Spanish speaker and fluent in English, which allows me to communicate effectively in both languages. I can also introduce or reinforce Spanish for your children if desired.\n\nI take pride in creating a safe, fun, and nurturing environment for kids, whether it's soothing a baby, organizing activities for toddlers, or helping older children with homework. I'm also very clean and organized, ensuring your home will be just as you left it-or even better!\n\nI'm available on weekends and occasionally weekdays, I can drive, making it convenient to assist with school pickups, errands, or activities.\n\nIf you're looking for a reliable and caring babysitter, I'd love to connect and support your family.

They should be encouraged to develop and explore their talents and learn in a fun interactive way. I have also been a substitute teacher and believe in structure that helps children grow. I can assist with cooking, meal preparation, and light housekeeping tasks. To ensure safety, I'm trained in CPR. I enjoy crafting reading cooking games and imaginative play as directed by the child.
