I am patient, motivated, caring, punctual, reliable, and can complete any tasks given to me. \n\nI have 6 years of babysitting experience ranging from 2 months old to 8 years old.\n\nI am CPR/BLS certified, bilingual (Spanish and English), have the ability to commute, flexible schedule if requested, and can do last minute gigs (date nights, emergency, etc.) \n\n*CASH ONLY*",
