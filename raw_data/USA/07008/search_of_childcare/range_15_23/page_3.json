I've been a babysitter for two different families for the past 3 years. For one of them, I take care of a 2-year-old and a 6-year-old. Duties include: taking care of them during date night, night time routine/putting them to bed, meal prep, taking the kids to afterschool activities or to the park, and morning/afternoon pickup/drop off. For my other job, I take care of a 10-year-old. My duties there include: taking her into NYC for afterschool activities, homework help, light housekeeping, school pick up, running errands, etc. As I said I've been working for these families for 3 years so I have plenty of experience. In addition to that, this past summer I worked part time taking care of a 4-month-old & 6-month-old baby.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you!",

She filled each day with creativity, patience, and genuine affection.\n\nHer ability to connect with our baby was remarkable. Whether it was through playful interactions, or just quiet moments of being present, she always knew how to make our child feel secure and cherished. It was evident that she has incredible work ethic and punctuality.\n\nWhat impressed us the most was her patience. Navigating the ups and downs of infancy can be challenging, but she handled every situation with grace and understanding. Her calm demeanor helped create a nurturing environment where our baby could thrive.\n\nWe felt so at ease knowing our child was in such loving hands. Her commitment to our family went beyond the basics. We cannot recommend her highly enough. Thank you for everything—you truly made a difference in our lives! Also, we miss you :(! ",
