I am a very outgoing and active person who adapts to environments well and relatively quick. I also have experience with many ages of children along with being comfortable watching groups. I have spent a lot of time helping not only my family out with my own siblings, but other families as well. \n\nI encourage keeping the children busy and active with things other than technology such as arts and crafts, reading, games, and outdoor activities.
