I've been volunteering at my local first aid squad for 3 years now and went to EMT school and I'm getting my emt certification. I'm currently getting a psychology and health studies degree and I'm also an anatomy major. I'm going to become a certified phlebotomist soon. I can provide basic Life support in any emergency + I'm CPR certified. I offer $20/hr for one child, $24 for 2 children/hr, $27 for 3 children/hr. Please don't hesitate to ask me any questions :)",

I truly enjoy watching children. I like to keep them occupied with their homework, playing games, painting/coloring, and also by spending time outdoors. I am very caring, compassionate, patient, and energetic. I love coming up with new interactive games to play with children whether inside or outside. Some things that I have experience with is pick up/drop offs from school, taking children to doctor appointments, driving children to sports practice, children meal prep, running errands, helping out with pets, nap time/bed time, and also bath time.

I'm patient, calm, friendly, and approachable, which helps me connect with children and build strong relationships with them. I'm also comfortable enforcing household rules to ensure a safe and nurturing environment. With 10 years of experience caring for children of all ages, I'm confident in my ability to provide a high-quality childcare experience.\n\nWhen it comes to communicating with parents, I believe in open and regular communication. I provide verbal updates at pickup and send regular text or phone call updates throughout the day. I'm also very comfortable enforcing household rules to ensure a safe and nurturing environment.\n\nMy favorite games to play with children are board games and puzzles, as they promote learning and interaction.",
