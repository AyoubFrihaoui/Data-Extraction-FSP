I'm patient, calm, and creative, and I love finding new and engaging ways to help children learn and grow. I'm also experienced in enforcing household rules in a gentle and consistent manner.\n\nI believe in open and transparent communication with parents and am happy to provide written daily reports or regular updates via text or phone, whichever method the parents prefer.

I have 3 nieces of my own , twin 1-year-olds and a 4-year-old, all who I love dearly and have given me ample experience multitasking ! My school work does not allow me to have a 9-5 job which is why babysitting is alluring to me because I get to build relationships with families and their kids that benefit my career down the line and the hours allow me to actually work through my semesters!

Watching children learn and grow is a true privilege, and I'm passionate about their development in a safe and nurturing environment. I have a formal and reserved personality, and I'm very comfortable enforcing household rules. I believe in open communication with parents and will provide regular updates on their child's day.\nI'm looking for a part time or full time job. I have my own vehicle.",
