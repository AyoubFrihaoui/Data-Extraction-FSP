I've been a babysitter for two different families for the past 3 years. For one of them, I take care of a 2-year-old and a 6-year-old. Duties include: taking care of them during date night, night time routine/putting them to bed, meal prep, taking the kids to afterschool activities or to the park, and morning/afternoon pickup/drop off. For my other job, I take care of a 10-year-old. My duties there include: taking her into NYC for afterschool activities, homework help, light housekeeping, school pick up, running errands, etc. As I said I've been working for these families for 3 years so I have plenty of experience. In addition to that, this past summer I worked part time taking care of a 4-month-old & 6-month-old baby.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you!",

I have just relocated to be with my boyfriend who is a Sergeant in NYPD. Together we have 3 children ages 4, 9, and 10. I also have recent experience with infants as a surrogate mother and was fortunate enough to have cared for this child for two months. \n\nIn my free time I enjoy running outside and feeling fresh air on my face, reading as many books as I possibly can, and I love to paint. \n\nI am looking for full time employment but could be open to part time as well. I am passionate about family values and spending time with children giving them undivided attention. \n\nI am open to a nanny setting where I come in the house care for children, help with cooking, cleaning, prepping for school or sports or anything that is going on. I am available to provide transportation as needed. We will enjoy time at home, along with any additional extracurriculars and/or approved outings.",

My experience includes being a nanny for a beautiful family with 3 children ages 4-7 and previously babysitting children ages 2-12. I am currently a full time nanny for a family residing in Westfield, children 7 months and 4 years old! (Baby is now almost 16 months). I also am a part time nanny for a second family in Westfield as well, children 7 months and 4 years old (baby is now 16 months). Babysitting and being with children comes naturally to me as I come from a very large family. I love helping babies learn to walk, reading and helping language development, and sensory/educational play. I love crafts, cooking/baking, playing outdoors, sports, reading, movie nights and overall having a fun time with children! I'm extremely friendly, fun, positive and easy going and most kids I know warm up to me real fast :). \n\nI am open on weekends whether it's an every week schedule or a date night out! I look forward to hearing from you and your family.",
