I'm very capable of \"running the show\" (both figuratively and literally). I've spent many years being a stage manager for various theatrical and dance performances through which I have worked with children of varied ages. Prior to my professional experiences as a School Counselor, I spent many years baby-sitting and working as a camp counselor in Bayonne and as both a Teacher's Assistant and Administrative Assistant for a summer enrichment program for gifted students at The Hudson School in Hoboken. Also, I have a very large extended family, so I am comfortable working with many people at one time. I'm very talkative, sociable, and organized.",
