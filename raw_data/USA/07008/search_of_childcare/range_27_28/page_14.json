I volunteered at a daycare to gain more experience and am currently taking classes to become a postpartum doula. I plan to go back to school to become a midwife.\n\nI thrive in busy, challenging environments and excel at planning and maintaining schedules. I tutored kids aged 6-13 for a year, so I'm skilled at helping with homework and fostering a love for learning. I'm also CPR certified, ensuring I can handle emergencies.\n\nIn my spare time, I enjoy painting and long walks to de-stress. Babysitting offers me the flexibility I need as I pursue my nursing career.\n\nChoosing me means choosing a dedicated, experienced, and reliable caregiver who is committed to your children's well-being. Thank you for considering me!",

These children have ranged from 6 months to 12 years of age.\nI have also worked as a mother's helper to a family with a special needs child. During that time I looked over a 7-year-old boy with autism while his parents were busy, attended doctor's appointments, speech therapy sessions, and performed arts and crafts activities with the child. \nI am a graduate of the SUNY New Paltz Speech-Pathology department with a minor in linguistics. Upon my graduation, I was offered a position working as a teacher's assistant at a university in Spain. In addition to working at the university, I taught private tutor sessions to children ranging from 6 years of age to 16. I also looked over these children when their parents were unable to do so. I will be starting a master's degree at Long Island University in September of this year. I will still be able to work during that time. \nI am a very responsible, fun-loving, flexible individual.
