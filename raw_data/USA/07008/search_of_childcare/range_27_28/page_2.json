I've worked with children ranging from 4 months to 14 years old, helping to support their growth, development, and learning at every stage. \n\nAs I seek a full-time childcare position, I'm looking forward to bringing my experience, attention to detail, and dedication to a family where I can create a safe and engaging environment. \n\nIf you're looking for a reliable, responsible, and experienced caregiver, I'd love to connect and discuss how I can support your family's needs!",

It was my positive experience in previous babysitting roles that motivated me to become a caregiver. With over 10+ years of experience, I'm patient, calm, creative, and friendly. I enjoy playing outdoor sports, board games, and educational games. I'm comfortable caring for one child from newborns to preteens. I'm happy to follow your household rules and will provide written daily reports, verbal communication at pickup, and regular updates. I have a car and am comfortable with pets. Whether it's teaching a child to swim or helping them with their homework, I strive to make a positive impact on their lives.",
