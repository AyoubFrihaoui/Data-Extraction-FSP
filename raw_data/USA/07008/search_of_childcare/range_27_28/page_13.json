The task I am capable of is quite varied, It includes serving children with nutritious meals, and entertaining them, doing laundry and light cleaning. I also have the ability to teach a couple of simple things such as reading, writing or foreign languages, and also help with homework. I'm very energetic and enjoy playing with kids. I also have experience with children with special needs and have worked with a Type 1 diabetic kid (6 years old) for 4 years. On top of all these, I am happy to work with children.
