My experience includes being a nanny for a beautiful family with 3 children ages 4-7 and previously babysitting children ages 2-12. I am currently a full time nanny for a family residing in Westfield, children 7 months and 4 years old! (Baby is now almost 16 months). I also am a part time nanny for a second family in Westfield as well, children 7 months and 4 years old (baby is now 16 months). Babysitting and being with children comes naturally to me as I come from a very large family. I love helping babies learn to walk, reading and helping language development, and sensory/educational play. I love crafts, cooking/baking, playing outdoors, sports, reading, movie nights and overall having a fun time with children! I'm extremely friendly, fun, positive and easy going and most kids I know warm up to me real fast :). \n\nI am open on weekends whether it's an every week schedule or a date night out! I look forward to hearing from you and your family.",

                  "originalText": "Imani was a phenomenal nanny to our son, and we were so lucky to have her.  Some key take-aways for me were i) caring and nurturing, ii) communication, and iii) punctuality.  \n\nFirst of all, Imani was such a loving and caring nanny for our now 7-month son.  The amount of smiles that he had each and every day with Imani were priceless.  She did a great job not only learning his routines, but also all of the queues that change over time and as he developed in his own special way.  I sincerely hope to stay connected with Imani and to continue having her be a part of our son's life as he continues to grow.\n\nSecond, her communication was top tier.  For me with a work schedule, it was great to be able to communicate with Imani throughout the day with updates.  I know she also sent many intraday fun pictures to my wife with all of the activities, walks and smiles!\n\nFinally, her professionalism and punctuality.  With us having very active lives, having consistency, punctuality and flexibility is key.  This was table stakes, and Imani never caused us to question this for a single moment.\n\nImani was a gift, and I could not recommend her high enough.  She was a fantastic caregiver to our son, and a pleasure to work with from the parent perspective.",

I graduated college about 2 years ago, and am currently working as a behavior technician for children with autism. I plan to go to nursing school in the spring, but am currently looking for babysitting jobs to help myself finance that, as well as offer my care and help to those who need it. \n\nI've always had a natural knack for working with children, and love to do it. I'm an energetic, caring, young at heart sitter, and love doing arts and craft, playing with dolls or blocks, or even helping with homework. I've had a plethora of jobs where I've worked with kids in different settings, including babysitting, swim lessons, substitute teaching, and ABA. No matter the job, I find immense gratification in working with the youth of our future, and find that kids love me for my fun and silly nature, whilst still being a responsible caregiver. \n\nI'm also fluent in Polish.",
