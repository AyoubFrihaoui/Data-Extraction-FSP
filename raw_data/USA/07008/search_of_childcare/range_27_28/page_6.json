I have babysat for a family of 2 (7 years old and infant) for the last 7 years and I am proud to say that they have turned into happy and healthy young teenagers today! I also volunteered at a summer program during my high school years when I was a teacher assistant and worked with 1 1/2-4-year-old kids in a classroom setting. I am full of energy to help with a child's daily schedule and understand the importance of the development of these early years in their life. My passion for working with children is demonstrated through my work and my nurturing and caring personality.",

I have experience caring for children of all ages, from infants to preteens, and I'm comfortable caring for up to three children at once.\n\nI have a college degree, and I'm CPR-certified and First Aid-certified. I'm confident in enforcing household rules and communicating effectively with parents about their child's day.\n\nI love playing outdoor sports and games, board games, puzzles, and educational games that promote learning. I'm also comfortable with pets. I'd be delighted to meet your family and learn more about your childcare needs.",
