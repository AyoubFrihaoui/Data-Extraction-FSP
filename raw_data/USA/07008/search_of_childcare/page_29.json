I have had experience with children ages 1month to 12 years old. When I was younger I watched 4 children on a daily basis when they came home from school until 8:00 p.m.  I helped them with thier homework, fed them dinner, bathed the children, and put them in bed. I would also babysit on the weekends for a family who had a son with special needs. I helped with all of the above and made sure he recieved all of his medication. I also have experience watching my younger sister and younger cousins. I am a certified nursing assistant, have been working in the hospital for a year. I am majoring in nursing wanting to be a RN for pediatrics. I enjoy working with kids and helping them in any way I could. I still continue to have exprience with children babysitting",
