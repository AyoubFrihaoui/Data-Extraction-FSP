During my time there I was promoted to a team leader where I was in charge of managing other teens. I had the opportunity to go on many professional visits and receive extensive one-on-one coaching and support from the directors and coordinators of the center. After graduating high school I began college and working at a charter school in Jersey City where I became an assistant teacher for 1st and 2nd grade. I also had the opportunity to babysit my former high school math teachers children after school hours and on weekends. Last May I was blessed with my baby girl, being a first time mother has been nothing but great. I have many years of experience with children. I am very patient, loving and reliable. Teaching and being around children is a passion of mine and I look forward to all the nanny opportunities that I will have.",

I received my masters in Special Education from the University of Kansas in 2021. I have my BA in Special Education from Kean University, as well as 3 teaching certifications. \n\nMy past work experience includes working for 13 years in a highly accredited child care center as a primary caregiver and director of their summer camp program. I have worked with children from 3 months old to 14 years old. I love children and helping them grow as individuals. I have also been teaching middle school English for the past 8 years.\n\nI love to play video/ board/ card games, go swimming, take pictures, go on adventures, and go to the beach.\n\nI am looking to develop relationships with a few more families that have a need for occasional evening and/or weekend sitter. I am open to one-time care jobs, as well as short notice. \n\nPlease contact me if you feel that I will be a good fit for your family.",
