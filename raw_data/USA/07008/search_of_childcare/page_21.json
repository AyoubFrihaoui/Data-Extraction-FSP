Growing up as the second of four siblings, I naturally took on the role of caring for my younger siblings. From helping with assignments and playing games to ensuring their well-being, every aspect of caretaking brings me fulfillment.\n\nMy patient, creative, and friendly personality allows me to connect easily with children. I believe in open communication with parents and prefer to discuss any issues at the end of the day to minimize worries. However, in urgent situations, parents would be notified immediately.\n\nI am very comfortable enforcing household rules and enjoy playing both educational games that promote learning and outdoor physical activities. With a college degree, First Aid Training, and CPR Training, I am well-equipped to handle various situations.",

Being a skilled swimmer myself, I would be thrilled to teach your children how to swim! Throughout my career, I've been entrusted to care for up to three children of various ages, ranging from infants to preteens.\n\nMy calm and patient nature, coupled with my creative and imaginative approach, has helped me connect with children and make their days fun and educational. I keep parents updated on their child's day and any issues that arise through regular verbal communication at pick-up and updates via text or phone call, whichever they prefer.\n\nWhen it comes to household rules, I'm very comfortable enforcing them, ensuring a safe and structured environment for the children in my care. In terms of activities, I enjoy engaging children in outdoor sports, board games, puzzles, and technology-based games and apps.",
