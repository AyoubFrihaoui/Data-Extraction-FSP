I'm fully COVID-19 vaccinated and boosted, and I hold a CPR certification. My experience ranges from caring for infants as young as 2 months to teenagers up to 15 years old, including those on the autism spectrum. I've also managed overnight care.\n\nI decided to become a caregiver because I find joy in building relationships with children and ensuring their safety. Being part of a family's team brings me immense happiness. I'm excited about the opportunity to meet your little bundle of joy!\n\nIn addition to childcare, I can cook, help with housekeeping, and assist with potty training. I'm flexible and available for various tasks around the house, including last-minute date nights on most occasions.\n\nFeel free to contact me anytime. I look forward to the possibility of working with your family!\n\nBest regards,\nJazmin",
