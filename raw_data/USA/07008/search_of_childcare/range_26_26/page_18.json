During this period I was trained, but not certified, to lifeguard and teach basic swim skills to children aged 3-12.\nOver the years I have worked and volunteered at various centers for the developmentally disabled, including facilities for both children and adults. \nI pride myself in my philosophy for early childhood education and growth.

I have also been a camp counselor for ages 2-12 and now work at a daycare center where I work primarily with infants, toddlers, and preschool age students. I love being an extension of the family when I babysit, making sure the children and parents feel comfortable and confident that they are safe. I pride myself into making sure every child is treated with nurturing care while also making sure to be engaged and interactive.",
