I am passionate about children because you can learn a lot from them, like how to enjoy the simple things in life. I have been working with children for the past 5 years in the position of babysitters, nanny and daycare assistant. I have worked with all ages from newborn to 15 years old. I love working with children and getting to know them and their individual personalities. Interactive choices and empowering others to be confident in their own freewill while still being respectful and honoring of those around them is key & helping them as they grow and face new challenges in school and life in general. I have worked with children in several different countries through relief work and various mission trips. I have a passion for childcare that I can not ignore. kids are simply my favorite to be around never a dull moment.",

I have custody of three children for about four years, 1 niece and 2 nephews, 1 has ADHD, but I have raised them since they were babies. I cook well, I clean well, and I love reading bedtime stories and singing, playing and dancing with children. Children are never to young to learn, that's why I love to implement age appropriate arts and crafts, or any other learning ideas that are fun and exciting. When children smile and laugh it brings complete joy to my heart knowing that I'm bringing joy to theirs. I am a quick learner, so whatever I can't do I can learn with no problems. I love to converse and share past stories and future goals. I love to help inspire, motivate, teach, and encourage children of all ages. Anything else I will be pleased to share. Thank you for your consideration, and I hope to become a part of your family.",

With three years of childcare experience, I've had the privilege of supporting families and providing reliable care for their children. My friendly and patient nature allows me to connect easily with children, creating a safe and nurturing environment. I keep parents informed throughout the day, using written reports and verbal communication at pickup, adhering to their preferred method of contact. Enforcing household rules comes naturally to me, ensuring a consistent and structured environment for the children in my care. From outdoor adventures to educational games, I enjoy a variety of activities that engage children and promote their learning and growth. Whether it's teaching them how to swim or helping them build their first puzzle, I find immense joy in being a part of their journey.",
