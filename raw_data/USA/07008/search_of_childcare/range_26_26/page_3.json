My daughter is at Wesleyan University playing lacrosse (proud mom) and my son is a senior in high school, committed to play lacrosse at St. Lawrence. I am also a former Westfield special education teacher and I provided early intervention for many years. I have been providing child care for newborns and up for over 15 years locally. In the last few years I have also taken on the role as house manager for several families. I have been fortunate to stay with the same families for years at a time and have the best working relationships with all of them. I am working part time now with 2 families so I only have part time hours available but can fill those with the right family. Feel free to contact me with your needs. Thanks!",
