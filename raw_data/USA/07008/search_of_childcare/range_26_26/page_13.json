I enjoy spending my time with children. I have participated in child development classes throughout my highschool years where I have gained college credits. Later on I began to work in a daycare for about 3 years. That's when I started to be an assistant teacher and later was promoted to become a lead teacher. I very much enjoyed my time as a teacher in the daycare and many of the students were sad when it was time to go and move on to my next chapter in life, but while I was teaching I also babysat some students in my class. Me and the kids would do fun and safe activities at home while the parents were out working/running errands. I'd like to think of myself as outgoing, adventurous and compassionate. Whenever I get the pleasure to be in the care of your child/children I will always make sure to put their safety first!!",

While I follow the parents' lead on household rules, I strive to create a safe and nurturing environment for children.

I recieved my BA in Child Advocacy, with minors in Psychology and Social Work from Montclair State University. I'm currently a MSW student at Rutgers University. I'm nearly 23 and have 12 years of experience working with children, from newborns to teenagers. I have had my license for almost 6 years, a reliable car and experience driving children. I am also Covid vaccinated and boosted. I aim to be an energetic nanny, who enjoys going on adventures, doing arts/crafts, and includes educational activities to encourage learning through play, while also promoting the accomplishment of developmental milestones.\nThank you!",
