I've had the pleasure of babysitting in the past, and I decided to take my passion for caregiving to the next level by becoming a professional childcare provider. I understand that choosing a childcare provider is a vital decision for parents, and I take the responsibility seriously. I believe that a caregiver should be a positive role model, and I strive to be just that for the children in my care. I'm patient, calm, creative, and friendly, and I always put the needs of the children first. I'm also very comfortable enforcing household rules and communicating with parents about their child's day or any issues that may arise. I can provide regular updates via text or phone call, or follow the parents' preferred communication method. If you're looking for a reliable, experienced, and loving childcare provider, I'm confident that I'm the perfect fit for your family.",

Since then I've worked for 2 years as a production coordinator at DreamWorks, and 3 years at professional bakeries. Currently I am working as a waitress in the mornings and am nanny-ing with a family in the afternoons. I am looking to work full time in child care. I would love to work with your family and make a difference in you and your child's life! \n\nI love arts and crafts, baking, and helping with homework. \nI have 6 plus years of experience in childcare and would be happy to provide references. I can help with Light Housekeeping, Swimming Supervision, picks/ drop offs, and homework. I recently have experience with children under 1 as my partner has a 1-year-old.",
