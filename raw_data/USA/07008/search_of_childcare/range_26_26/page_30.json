I have experience watching kids of all ages, and have grown a passion for working with kids. I currently work part time with a family I have been with since 2021 and watch their 2 children, a boy and a girl ages 9 and 11. Not too long ago, I worked for another family and watched their three young sons, ages 2, 4, and 5 and a half. I also cared for a young baby one summer, aged 6 months and sometimes aided in watching his brothers, aged 3 and 5. In addition to these jobs, I have worked here and there for parents on nights out, errand runs, or any other small one time thing. I have also received certifications in CPR and first aid! I am very comfortable with pets as I have had my own my whole life and also do some pet sitting in my area. I am also happy to help with light housekeeping if needed. If our times align, I would be honored to help you out",

When I'm not at work I enjoy spending time with my friends and family, traveling, and learning about and tending to my 20+ plant babies! \nFun fact : I'm a big kid at heart so I enjoy doing arts & crafts, using my imagination, cooking/ baking & exploring with the children I care for! I love being able to point out new things to children and watch their face light up because they've learned something new! I'm here to make life a little easier. I do everything pertaining to the children.... Laundry, cleaning/ organizing toys, meals, bath time & other activities. You name it, I can do it! I pride myself on asking questions when I'm confused and communicating with parents so neither one of us are left in the dark about anything! I look forward to joining your family and making Iife just a bit easier!",
