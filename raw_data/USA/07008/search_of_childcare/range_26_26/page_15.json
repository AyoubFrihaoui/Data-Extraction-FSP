I've worked with kids of all ages K-12 and Freshman-Sophomores in college. All experiences rewarding and at times challenging. But, I'm honored to have had a hand in their development.\n\nIn my spare time, I like to read, learn new languages, create pottery, journal, move my body (walking, yoga, dance), sing, cook, and spending time with my loved ones.\n\nOne thing you should know about me is that I am a family oriented person.

I have a younger sister, as well, so I am constantly around children. I am very organized, responsible, and energetic. I love to create fun and exciting activities for children to do, as seeing a smile on a someone's face brings me such joy. I have a background of babysitting children of all ages, infants to young teens, both male and female. During my time babysitting, I have been responsible for tutoring, driving children around, preparing food, and creating a fun and safe environment. Additionally, as part of my studies in high school I took a course called Tomorrow's Teachers, which gave me the opportunity to work with many different students, ranging from first to sixth grade. I am a recent college graduate with an accounting degree. On campus I was involved in a club that focuses on aiding battered women and their children, which I very involved in.",
