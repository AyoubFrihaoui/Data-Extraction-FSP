I grew up in Trenton NJ but have seen many parts of the world thanks to the great families I had the opportunity to work with. Honestly I had an affinity for children at a early age. I loved babysitting my nieces and nephews when I was a teen, especially during the summer. I'm proud to say that this made me realize later in life that I enjoy working with juveniles. Nannying influenced my career choice for school which is a duel major in early childhood education and law enforcement. Thanks to my schooling and experience with all ages I can always invent creative and fun games. I find that children have always connected to my personality and my exciting spirit. I love being a nanny; it is the most rewarding and fulfilling job out there. Children are a delightful gift: they bring so much joy to my heart and make everyday so much better.",

Open communication with parents is essential, so I offer verbal updates at pickup and regular text or phone call updates throughout the day to ensure everyone is on the same page. I have no qualms about enforcing household rules to maintain a structured and harmonious home.\n\nFrom outdoor sports and physical games to educational games and technology-based apps, I have a diverse range of activities up my sleeve to keep the kids engaged and entertained.
