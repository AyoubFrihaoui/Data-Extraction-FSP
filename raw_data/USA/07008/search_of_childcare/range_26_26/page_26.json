Holding a bachelors of science in mathematics and computer science, I began a five-year journey as an active nanny and tutor during college. As a nanny I cared for children aged 3 to 13, focusing on interactive screen-free play to promote essential life skills. Whether through physical activities, math, games, or arts and crafts, I strive to make learning fun.\n\nAs a math tutor, I specialize in courses from pre-school to college. I earned recognition from employers for my hundred percent success rate in helping students pass math placement tests and aspiring teachers clear their PRAXIS exams. My adaptable teaching style meets each students unique needs, ensuring no one falls behind. Having worked with large groups of students at a time I excel at managing multiple learners simultaneously.\n\nAs for pet care I maintain two cats and a dog at home.",
