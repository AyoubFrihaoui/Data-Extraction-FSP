I have experience with ages 3 mos. to 13 years and with up to four kids at a time. I believe a babysitter / nanny plays an important role in a child's life, I will always treat children as if they were my own. I am always interacting with the child as much as I can and will always have activities and crafts ready to keep things fun and productive. I love reading and singing songs / dancing with the children. I am experienced in homework help as well as teaching younger children their ABC's and 123's in fun and creative ways. I strongly believe that communication between parents and the babysitter / nanny is crucial to ensure that all needs are being met and I am always open to make accommodations if need be.",

I did all sorts of tasks for them from running errands to dog training. Also, I was responsible for many other animals (rabbits, snakes, guinea pigs, and cats). While all kids were in school all day, I took on a second job with the YMCA teaching kids under 6 to swim. After the nannying job, I started my own family & now have 4 kids of my own, so I have had lots of experience in taking care of people. I love people & animals of all kinds. I'm also very handy & can fix all sorts of things. I have been cleaning & organizing homes for as long as I can remember. I love the outdoors & hanging out with friends. I hope you consider me for helping you get things done.",
