I have been so impressed by Yaira's approach, and how quickly my daughter got accustomed to her. It's also obvious to us that her learning and development has accelerated since Yaira started watching her. She ensures that the day is filled with a combination of reading, playing, outdoor time and creative activities. \nSecondly, she is a great help to us as parents. She has easily taken any instruction we've given, she is solution oriented, and always curious how she can be more helpful. Also, despite play and fun, the house is always spotless. ",

I am a very reliable, patient, energetic and proactive person who has approximately 10 years of experience caring for children, from infants to teenagers and more than 25 years experience in swimming. With me, your children will receive appropriate care. \nI'm willing to do additional other tasks as light housekeeping, fresh meal preparation and laundry if requested. Personally, I'm organized, planner and multitasker, so minimum supervision is required.

Layla is independent, needs very little direction, and is proactive when it comes to finding play dates, organizing activities, and helping our son socialize, which we had expressed as important for us. Layla loves our children as if they are her own. We have hundreds of pictures of her with the kids and you can see the pure joy and love on their faces. I could go on and on, but I will end by saying there is no greater gift you can give a mother than truly loving and caring for her children - and Layla does just that.",
