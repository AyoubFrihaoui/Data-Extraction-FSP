I have had experience with children ages 1month to 12 years old. When I was younger I watched 4 children on a daily basis when they came home from school until 8:00 p.m.  I helped them with thier homework, fed them dinner, bathed the children, and put them in bed. I would also babysit on the weekends for a family who had a son with special needs. I helped with all of the above and made sure he recieved all of his medication. I also have experience watching my younger sister and younger cousins. I am a certified nursing assistant, have been working in the hospital for a year. I am majoring in nursing wanting to be a RN for pediatrics. I enjoy working with kids and helping them in any way I could. I still continue to have exprience with children babysitting",

I believe in open communication with parents, providing daily reports and regular updates to ensure everyone is on the same page.\n\nWhile I prefer a flexible approach to household rules, I prioritize safety and age-appropriate boundaries. My idea of fun includes outdoor sports, board games, and educational activities that promote learning. I'm comfortable caring for two children simultaneously and have experience with various age groups.\n\nI hold a high school degree and have completed First Aid and CPR training. Besides childcare, I can assist with cooking, light housekeeping, travel, and swimming supervision.\n\nI'm excited about the opportunity to connect with your family and contribute to your children's growth.

When getting my bachelor I worked for one family just watching their two children after school. Once summer hit they went to camp, they were also pretty big so they only needed me for the year. For the rest of my bachelor I worked with two boys in Westfield that I loved. After them I started working in day cares with babies and young children which are my favorite. Once Covid hit I choose to go back to school online and become a full time nanny Now I have my own baby. I'm looking for a family that will let me watch their child with my own child. He is 3 months old and super easy going. I have a lot of experience handing many children at once, so I believe I would be able to give mine and your what they need.",

I strive to provide a safe, nurturing, and stimulating environment for your little ones. I'm known for my patience, creativity, and friendly nature, making me an approachable caregiver for both children and parents.\n\nI believe in open and honest communication with parents. I provide regular updates on your child's day, whether it's through verbal communication at pickup, text messages, or phone calls. I respect the parents' preferred communication method and follow their lead when it comes to enforcing household rules. My favorite activities to engage in with children are educational games that foster learning. I am currently located in Union, NJ. I am a full time stay at home mom to my 10-month-old daughter. I am looking to work with local working families who need childcare services while they are away at work.",
