Love above all because when you love children you simply take care of them as if they were yours and instinctively you protect them and give them the best of you. Followed by all the activities they have, their physical and personal development. I really like activities outside the home such as taking the children to parks, library, music classes, sports and also activities inside the house such as painting, art and craft, reading books, homework and many other things. Help with children's clothes and healthy meals. I hope to have the opportunity to find a new family with whom to start a new chapter of my life with a lot of love!",

I started off caring for my younger siblings until they were old enough to care for themselves. As the years progressed, I continued to care for the children within my family. Professionally, I began to working at a local daycare for approximately 2 and a half years, which is where I discovered my passion for caring for children. I've worked with children from the ages of 3 months to 12 years old, including children with special needs.

My strength lies in my patience and my\nability to communicate, ensuring that every child feels valued and understood. \nI'm well-versed in keeping toddlers safe and school-aged children entertained without the crutch of screen time. My goal is to foster an environment where creativity and curiosity flourish.\nMy experience with working with children of all ages has taught me that every child is a world unto themselves, deserving of patience,\nunderstanding, and support.",

I started babysitting when I was a 15 years old for a family friend, and I have been babysitting ever since. After that I went on to working with this beautiful family for 3 years until all of their children went to school. I later went on to work as a Assistant Teacher, working with children from 2. 5 years old to 5 years old. I love working with kids of all ages because every age teaches you something new. I am fluent in English and Creole and I can also help with school work and any other tasks that need to be completed. I am also CPR and First Aid certified.",
