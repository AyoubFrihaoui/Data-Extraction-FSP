I have over 3+ years of experience as a sitter caring for children ages 6 months - 12 years old. In addition to my caregiving experience I have also worked with children in classroom settings as a writing coach as well as an art instructor! In these roles I gained immense experience not only caring for children but developing their artistic expression and imagination! I would love to work with you!",
