My background in early childhood education, coupled with my friendly and patient nature, allows me to connect easily with children and create a nurturing environment. I believe in open communication with parents and will promptly address any concerns or updates regarding their child's day.\n\nWhen it comes to enforcing household rules, I'm very comfortable doing so in a gentle yet firm manner. I understand the importance of consistency and structure for children, and I work closely with parents to ensure their expectations are met.\n\nMy approach to childcare is holistic and engaging. I love playing outdoor sports and physical games with children, as well as board games and puzzles. I also encourage imaginative play and am always up for a good adventure.\n\nIn addition to my childcare experience, I'm proficient in English and Spanish, and I'm certified in First Aid and CPR.",

While I respect the household rules set by the parents, I am also comfortable enforcing them consistently. From engaging in outdoor sports and physical games to playing board games and puzzles, I enjoy a variety of activities that promote learning and fun. As a native English and Spanish speaker, I am comfortable caring for children from diverse backgrounds. I am also willing to assist with light housekeeping tasks.

I'm patient and calm with a creative and imaginative nature, I'm also very comfortable with enforcing household rules. I have experience caring for children of all ages from infants to teens! as well as caring for up to four children at a time. I enjoy playing sports, board games, puzzles, and educational games with children. I'm extremely comfortable communicating with parents about their child's day and any issues that arise, and I follow their preferred communication method. I firmly believe that open and honest communication is key to building trust with families.",
