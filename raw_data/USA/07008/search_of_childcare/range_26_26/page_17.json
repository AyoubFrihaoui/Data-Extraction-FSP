I also do house work; such as clean, laundry, food preparation and pick ups and drops offs. My main purpose is to make life just a little bit easier for you. Anything I can do to make things easier, I am willing to do. I am willing to nanny at your home or at my place. Whichever you are comfortable with. I am looking for something full time and I am willing to provide references. I am COVID Vaccinated and I have the booster. I am CPR certified & have background in early childhood education. I have worked with children who have special needs & have worked with kids from ages 2 weeks to 19 years old! Hopefully I can be the right fit for your family.
