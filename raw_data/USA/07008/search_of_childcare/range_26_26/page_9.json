My journey into caregiving began as an assistant teacher at a daycare and occasionally consists of babysitting roles, which sparked my desire to make a positive impact on young lives. I've gained valuable experience caring for children of various ages, and I'm comfortable looking after up to many children at a time, due to experiences as a teacher. I prioritize open communication with parents. I believe in providing regular updates about their child's day and promptly addressing any concerns or issues that arise, using the parents' preferred communication method. I'm also very comfortable enforcing household rules and ensuring a safe and structured environment for the children in my care.\n\nMy approach to childcare is centered around creativity and imagination. I enjoy engaging children in outdoor sports and physical games, as well as board games and puzzles.",

Her nurturing and caring nature has made a profound impact on our family, and we are incredibly grateful for the time she has spent with us. From the beginning, Corrine demonstrated a deep commitment to our daughter’s well-being and development. She collaborated with us to create and implement monthly curriculum and provided thorough, insightful reports on our daughter's progress. Her support extended beyond childcare; she helped with housekeeping and took initiative to ease our workload. Her suggestions regarding meal planning, as well as her creative ideas for activities like arts and crafts, water play, and outings to the park, library, and neighborhood walks, were greatly appreciated. Her Montessori-inspired approach to fostering our daughter’s development and independence transformed our space into a mini classroom, offering a limitless learning experience. Corrine has provided exceptional care and support, and we highly recommend her to any family looking for someone dedicated and skilled. ",
