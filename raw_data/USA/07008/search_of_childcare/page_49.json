My journey in caregiving began with fulfilling babysitting roles, which inspired me to pursue a career in early childhood development.\n\nPatient and calm, I believe in open and honest communication with parents. I provide regular updates on their child's day and address any issues promptly, following their preferred communication method.\n\nComfortable enforcing household rules, I ensure a safe and structured environment for children. With my love for outdoor activities, I enjoy playing sports and physical games, as well as engaging in board games and puzzles.

She always went above and beyond for us. Even when the kids were resting/napping she was often turning over the dishwasher or folding clothes for us, even though we let her know that she was more than welcome to take a rest as well. Susan would think of new, fun and creative activities to do with the kids and I feel like they have grown and learned a lot this summer with her. I would highly recommend her!",
