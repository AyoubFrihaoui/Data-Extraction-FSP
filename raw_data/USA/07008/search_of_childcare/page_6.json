I have experience watching over children and helping with their needs. In the summer of 2017, I was given a chance to work around children and since then I've spent my summers as a counselor, teacher, and assistant working with different age groups in various environments such as camps and daycares. I have over 7 years of experience. I often travel through the boroughs to try new restaurants, visit new places or go to dance classes so I'm open to babysitting anywhere! I like to spend my free time reading, dancing, cooking, doing yoga and trying new hobbies such as roller skating. I would describe myself as being kind, creative, respectful and adventurous. I'm open to working late and I'm great with pets. I'm looking forward to being an addition to your family and creating a safe place and comfortable atmosphere for your children to thrive in.",

I could not ask for a more caring and fun caretaker for a child, as well as a friendly, communicative and flexible employee for our household. Mari prepares healthy meals, partners with us on transitions like potty training and keeps us updated every day with pictures and news about our daughter’s day including any concerns she thinks we should be aware of like a sniffle or hard time napping. She proactively researches new games and activities for our daughter, finding great free events around town to give her new experiences and always gives 100% of her energy and joy to our family. She works with us on our schedule when I have to travel for work or we need her to come earlier or stay later. I would recommend her to any family - I only wish she could come with us as we’re moving away for a new job.  We are so lucky that Mari is a part of our daughter’s life.",

From 16 I worked at many daycares and summer camps with family friends. I also intend to open and apply for both a daycare and Charter School once I graduate. \n\nI'm looking for a job that will treat me like family.\n\nI started working with kids when I was 16.\n\nIn my spare time, I like to play volleyball.\n\nOne thing you should know about me is I get very attached once a bond is created, so I'm super sensitive about parting ways lol.\n\nMy skills include the Creative-thinking, compassion, child-development.",
