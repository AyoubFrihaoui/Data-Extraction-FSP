Working as an Elementary School Teacher for the past 7 years, plus over 10 years of childcare experience has opened my eyes and heart to children's needs-- academically, socially, and emotionally. \n\nI absolutely love what I do and wish to broaden its impact through tutoring and childcare. I also hope to use my passion to help families establish normalcy during this uncertain time by providing individualized care and/or instruction. \n\nSome of my favorite tutoring subjects and activities include reading comprehension, writing, math, science, social studies, organization, study habits, and test-taking preparation.\n\nIn childcare positions, I love arts & crafts, exploring nature, games, imaginative play/theatre, building, developing communication skills, and working on whatever goals the parents have set for their child(ren). \n\nHope to hear from you soon!\nCorinne",

Her nurturing and caring nature has made a profound impact on our family, and we are incredibly grateful for the time she has spent with us. From the beginning, Corrine demonstrated a deep commitment to our daughter’s well-being and development. She collaborated with us to create and implement monthly curriculum and provided thorough, insightful reports on our daughter's progress. Her support extended beyond childcare; she helped with housekeeping and took initiative to ease our workload. Her suggestions regarding meal planning, as well as her creative ideas for activities like arts and crafts, water play, and outings to the park, library, and neighborhood walks, were greatly appreciated. Her Montessori-inspired approach to fostering our daughter’s development and independence transformed our space into a mini classroom, offering a limitless learning experience. Corrine has provided exceptional care and support, and we highly recommend her to any family looking for someone dedicated and skilled. ",

I am a very sweet, caring, trustworthy and reliable person. I have a passion for children and I truly enjoy being with them. I have experience with kids ranging from 5 months old to 12 years old. In my current and past jobs I had a variety of duties ranging from changing diapers, feeding, nap time, potty training, to grocery shopping, running errands or pick up/drop offs. I have a lot of fun with the kids I take care of. I enjoy bringing them to the park, going for strolls around the neighborhood or doing a bunch of other outdoor and indoor activities. I am capable of light cooking, cleaning or homework help and I am willing to help out all around. You can rely on me to always be there and treat your child/children as if they were one of my own. I hope to hear from you soon!",
