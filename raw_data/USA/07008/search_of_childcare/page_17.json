I love tapping into my inner child and seeing the joy on their faces after every accomplishment. I love working with kids because it allows you to see growth and progress in amazing, measurable ways. \n\nI'd describe my personality as gentle, charismatic, outgoing and nurturing. In my spare time I like to go on runs , paint, as well as read, and watch the sunset on the beach!\n\nSome of my valued skills are CPR certified , organization, planning , and creativity!",

It was my positive experience in previous babysitting roles that motivated me to become a caregiver. With over 10+ years of experience, I'm patient, calm, creative, and friendly. I enjoy playing outdoor sports, board games, and educational games. I'm comfortable caring for one child from newborns to preteens. I'm happy to follow your household rules and will provide written daily reports, verbal communication at pickup, and regular updates. I have a car and am comfortable with pets. Whether it's teaching a child to swim or helping them with their homework, I strive to make a positive impact on their lives.",
