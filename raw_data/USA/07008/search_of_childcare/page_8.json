My daughter is at Wesleyan University playing lacrosse (proud mom) and my son is a senior in high school, committed to play lacrosse at St. Lawrence. I am also a former Westfield special education teacher and I provided early intervention for many years. I have been providing child care for newborns and up for over 15 years locally. In the last few years I have also taken on the role as house manager for several families. I have been fortunate to stay with the same families for years at a time and have the best working relationships with all of them. I am working part time now with 2 families so I only have part time hours available but can fill those with the right family. Feel free to contact me with your needs. Thanks!",

I've worked with children ranging from 4 months to 14 years old, helping to support their growth, development, and learning at every stage. \n\nAs I seek a full-time childcare position, I'm looking forward to bringing my experience, attention to detail, and dedication to a family where I can create a safe and engaging environment. \n\nIf you're looking for a reliable, responsible, and experienced caregiver, I'd love to connect and discuss how I can support your family's needs!",

I drive, and am comfortable running errands or helping with chores, heating up/making simple meals or any other tasks that you need assistance with besides your munchkin!\n\nI believe care. com performs a background check, but it's my church policy to run a background check on anyone who is volunteering and I have a copy from a year-year and a half ago that I'd be willing to share. \n\nReferences available upon request and feel free to ask any questions!

She was very personable and nice to be around in our home. At first our boy was clingy and upset to be left with someone new, but by the end of her time with us he was very excited to see her when she arrived. She read him a lot of books, took him for walks and talked to him a lot, showing him things around the house and neighborhood. She even wrote a nice letter of tips and tricks for the new nanny, which showed how thoughtful she was. She was happy to take instructions and do things the way we ask. She kept us updated on the app that we use and by sending photos during the day. We appreciated having her help and were sad to see her go. ",
