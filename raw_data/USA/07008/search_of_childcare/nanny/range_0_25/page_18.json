I'm willing to teach, play with, dress up, bathe, put the little snug bugs to bed, and more! My schedule is flexible and I want to fill up my hours as much as possible for the summer. I've been volunteering at my local first aid squad for 3 years now and went to EMT school and I'm getting my emt certification. I'm currently getting a psychology and health studies degree and I'm also an anatomy major. I'm going to become a certified phlebotomist soon. I can provide basic Life support in any emergency + I'm CPR certified. I offer $20/hr for one child, $24 for 2 children/hr, $27 for 3 children/hr. Please don't hesitate to ask me any questions :)",
