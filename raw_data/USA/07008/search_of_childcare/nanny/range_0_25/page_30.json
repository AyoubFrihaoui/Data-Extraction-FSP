I believe in open communication with parents, providing regular updates and following their preferred methods. When it comes to household rules, I enforce them with confidence and consistency. My favorite moments with children are spent outdoors, playing sports or engaging in physical activities. We also enjoy board games, puzzles, and educational games that stimulate young minds. With early child development coursework as part of my training, I can ensure a nurturing and enriching environment for your child. From cooking and meal preparation to light housekeeping and travel, I'm happy to assist in various tasks. I'm available to care for one child at a time and would be delighted to bring my skills and enthusiasm to your family.",
