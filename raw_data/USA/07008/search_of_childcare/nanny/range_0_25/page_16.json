I've been baby sitting my family and friends kids starting from a young age, so this is something I'm great at , I have patience , compassion and good communication skills to ensure a positive experience for both the children and their parents. I would be entrusted with the important task of caring for a child's well-being, which requires attention to detail and the ability to stay calm under pressure. I'm very big on cleaning houses, keeping everything neat and organized for when everyone comes home , I like to adventure around and interact with the little ones, I love to paint and draw , being outdoors it's something I enjoy , I'm also a 4th year college student criminal justice major doing this as a little side job until I go back to school , I'm also a hostess Friday through Sunday , I can also speak Spanish (Uruguayan ) overall, if you're interested, we can chat if my hours do not work with you and we can make an arrangement !

Currently serving as an Assistant Head of School at Guidepost Montessori, I continue to expand my understanding of child development and the importance of fostering a safe and enriching educational atmosphere.
