Furthermore, I am former employee of a family entertainment company for over two years where I maintained and fun and safe space. I had a practicum as a school counseling student intern in Rahway public schools. I assisted in maintaining confidentiality, compassion, and assistance to insure that the students will be the best versions of themselves. I gained the capabilities of handling children no matter the age while giving them a worthwhile experience they talk about time and time again. I would love the opportunity to demonstrate.

With my calm and imaginative nature, I create a fun and engaging atmosphere for children to learn, play, and thrive.\n\nI prioritize open communication with parents and believe in providing regular updates about their child's day. I adapt to the preferred communication method of each family, whether it's verbal updates at pickup, text messages, or phone calls.\n\nEnforcing household rules is essential for a harmonious environment, and I'm very comfortable doing so in a gentle yet firm manner. From outdoor sports to board games and technology-based apps, I enjoy a variety of games that cater to different interests and age groups.\n\nI'm seeking a position where I can positively impact the life of one child and support their family.",
