Although I'm new to the field, I'm eager to learn and grow as a childcare provider. I have a car and am comfortable caring for one child between the ages of 0 and 11.

I have been babysitting since I was 12 years old. Twins, triplets, special needs- you name it. I adapt to all situations and have no problem doing housework, activities, driving or going the extra mile with anything that will work for the child/children and the family. I have excellent references from family, friends, current and previous coworkers and bosses as well as families that I have worked for. Overnights are no problem. I am a chemist by trade but have been doing supply chain management for many years. In my spare time, I study history and spend time with my nieces and nephew. I come from a very close loving family and pass that along to the children that I care for. I have spend many years with families until the children no longer needed a babysitter.",
