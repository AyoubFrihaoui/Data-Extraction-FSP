One of the boys doesn't have it as bad he talks small sentences but the other one doesn't speak at all. So I had to learn how to feel what he's feeling so I can understand him.

Although I'm new to the field, I'm eager to learn and grow as a childcare provider. I have a car and am comfortable caring for one child between the ages of 0 and 11. I'm fluent in both English and Spanish, which allows me to communicate with a diverse range of families.\n\nI am excited about the opportunity to support families and provide a reliable childcare option for them.",
