For about 10 years , I was left in charge of children ages from babies to 17 years old. This might not be easy but my love for children and having more patient is making it quite enjoyable. At the same time I use this experience to becoming my dream of being a Pediatrician. I hope to get the opportunity to cater for child/children and make their young lives very memorable. I will also be glad if I am given the chance to use my quantities as a caregiver at your workplace. Thank you.",
