After graduating high school I began college and working at a charter school in Jersey City where I became an assistant teacher for 1st and 2nd grade. I also had the opportunity to babysit my former high school math teachers children after school hours and on weekends. Last May I was blessed with my baby girl, being a first time mother has been nothing but great. I have many years of experience with children. I am very patient, loving and reliable.

I've been a nanny, babysitter, mother's help and I currently have a 8yo boy (who WON'T depend on me during working hours). I currently work for a family and I'm looking for a second job.\n\nIn my spare time, I like to play tennis and enjoy my family.\n\nMy skills include being understanding, following directions and being pro active.\nI have knowledge in gentle parenting and ADHD resources and tools. \n\nI believe in respecting children, leading by example and guiding them through difficult times.
