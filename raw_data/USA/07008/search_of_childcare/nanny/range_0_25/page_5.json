My background & passion is in Mental Health & the arts. Right after college, I spent a few years working at Person Centered Care Services in Staten Island as a Direct Support Professional, teaching independent living skills to kids with special needs & developmental disorders. Following this, I was introduced to nannying and have worked with several families. I have a cat & I'm a huge dog lover. I enjoy being on the go & helping others.\n\nWith that being said, it's important to me that I work with a family that practices healthy relational dynamics & prioritizes the mental & emotional well-being of their children. If you have read this far, and feel that I might be a good match for your family, let's talk further.",
