Effective communication is key, so I ensure regular updates and follow the parents' preferred communication method to keep them informed about their child's day.\n\nEnforcing household rules comes naturally to me, and I have experience caring for one child at a time. In terms of activities, I enjoy engaging children in outdoor sports, board games, puzzles, and educational games that stimulate their learning.\n\nMy educational background includes some college coursework, and I have completed First Aid and CPR training.

After spending the past year helping my sister raise her twin daughters from birth, I'm excited to get back into babysitting part-time.\n\nI've been babysitting on and off since I was 13 and love forming strong, trusting bonds with children. My focus is always on making them feel safe, valued, and free to express their individuality. Whether it's through creative activities, outdoor play, yoga, art, or just engaging conversations, I strive to nurture their confidence and curiosity.\n\nWith a completely flexible schedule, I'm available to accommodate your family's needs.

I'm comfortable caring for up to two children, ranging from infants to pre-teens. Although I have some college education, my skills and experience speak for themselves, and I've completed CPR training.\n\nOn a personal note, I don't have a car but I have reliable transportation , am comfortable with pets, and am more than willing to help with cooking and light housekeeping.",

I graduated college about 2 years ago, and currently work as a behavior technician for children with autism. I plan to go to nursing school in the spring, so I'm currently looking for babysitting jobs to help finance that, as well as offer my care and help to those who need it.\n\nI've always had a natural knack for working with children, and love to do it. I'm an energetic, caring, young at heart sitter, and love doing arts and craft, playing with dolls or blocks, or even helping with homework. I've had a plethora of jobs where I've worked with kids in different settings, including babysitting, swim lessons, substitute teaching, and ABA. I find immense gratification in working with the youth of our future, and find that kids love me for my fun and silly nature, while still being a responsible caregiver.\n\nI'm also fluent in Polish.\n\nOnly one-time or occasional jobs please.\nAvailable after 5 p.m. Mon-Thurs, after 2 p.m. Frida",

With a friendly and approachable personality, I'm skilled at keeping kids entertained and engaged with educational games, creative activities, and outdoor play. I believe in open and honest communication with parents, providing regular updates and following their preferred communication method. While I prefer a flexible approach to household rules, I'm comfortable setting boundaries and ensuring a safe and nurturing environment. Whether it's teaching your kids to swim or helping them with their homework, I'm dedicated to supporting their individual needs and helping them thrive. Finally, I reiterate that my language is Spanish, but I can get by a bit in English, however it may be an advantage for your children that I can teach them Spanish.",
