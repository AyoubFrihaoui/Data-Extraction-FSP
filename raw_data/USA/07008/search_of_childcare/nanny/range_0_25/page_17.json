They should be encouraged to develop and explore their talents and learn in a fun interactive way. I have also been a substitute teacher and believe in structure that helps children grow. I can assist with cooking, meal preparation, and light housekeeping tasks. To ensure safety, I'm trained in CPR. I enjoy crafting reading cooking games and imaginative play as directed by the child.

My journey into childcare began with fulfilling babysitting roles, where I discovered my passion for nurturing young minds and making a positive impact on their lives.\n\nMy patient and calm nature, coupled with my creativity and imagination, allows me to connect with children on a deeper level. I believe in open and honest communication with parents, providing daily written reports and regular updates to ensure they are always informed about their child's day.\n\nWhen it comes to enforcing household rules, I am very comfortable and consistent in my approach. I strive to create a safe and structured environment where children can thrive.\n\nFrom engaging in outdoor sports and physical games to enjoying board games and puzzles, I love exploring various activities that cater to different learning styles and interests.",
