I will be receiving my bachelors degree in Social Work, May of 2023, and I am looking for a nanny job to support me along the way!\n\nI am very passionate about working with youth and families! Since the age of 16, I have worked in day care centers and elementary schools. Throughout my professional and academic journey, I have expanded my experience to working with middle school & high school aged children. Outside of my professional experience, I am the youngest of 7 children and I have many nieces and nephews.

In the past I have babysat for 5 children at once for 2 years, besides many other kids. Another family I cared for had a 2-year-old and a mother who had just given birth. I babysat the newborn the first day back from the hospital. I cared for one reoccurring family on a weekly basis for eight years and now as the kids need less care I am looking to take on a new family. I currently own my own photography business which allows me the flexibility to pick to babysitting as well.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you and being able to give the next family the peace of mind that they have a well qualified babysitter.",
