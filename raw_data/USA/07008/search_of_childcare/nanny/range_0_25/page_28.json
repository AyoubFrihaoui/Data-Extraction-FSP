In 2002 after my son was born I worked at our church as an aftercare teacher working with pre-k up to 8th grade . I loved the interaction with all of the kids but then I moved and had to leave that job . A very dear friend of mine reached out to me in need of a nanny for her 8-month-old daughter in July of 2018 I began taking care of her . Teaching her ABC's , numbers, colors , songs and etc. Unfortunately I had to leave in March of 2020 due to Covid . I miss taking care of kids watching them laugh , smile , learn and grow .
