I'm very patient and loving, I'm comfortable with taking care of pets, meal prep, and dropping off and picking up from activities. I love play time and I'm good with arts and crafts. I did community service as an assistant in an after-school program for middle schoolers so I have a lot of experience helping out with homework and school projects. I worked at a Daycare school for 3 years as a Pre-K assistant teacher and eventually became a Preschool lead teacher. I have a driver's license with a clean record and my own car. I'm First Aid/AED/CPR certified for Adult and Pediatrics. I speak Spanish fluently. I'm fully vaccinated against Covid 19. I would be happy to help in anything I could!",
