I'm a toddler mom and I have experience effectively interacting with infants and educating toddlers working towards specific age-appropriate milestones. While also creating a fun and interactive environment planning activities that both entertained and stimulated the children. I also worked in 2 daycares where I created a safe and nurturing childcare environment for up to 15 children ranging from 3 months old to 4 years old collaborating with two other caregivers. While clearly communicating and coordinating with parents to understand each child's specific needs and desires. I maintained a clean environment by changing diapers daily, potty training dozens of children, and regularly sanitizing surfaces. \nI would love to hear more about your family and what you are looking for in a nanny. \n(I am also open to long term/short term/one time jobs.) \nI can't wait to hear from you :)",

I would like to start putting more funds towards paying off my student loan debt so working a part time job will be helpful. I graduated from the University of Miami in 2018 and since then, I have worked in the energy industry as a Project Engineer. Due to my career, I have sharp interpersonal, STEM, and communication skills. My experience is with 8-year-old and 13-year-old child care for 3 years. In addition, I have been a very active helping hand for my siblings by assisting in child care for my nieces/nephews. I have always loved the idea of working with children and being a positive, guiding element of someone's childhood. I believe through tutoring or a care position, I can do that. I am open to various opportunities so please feel free to reach out to me and ask any questions you would like. Looking forward to connecting!",

I am reliant, trustworthy, honest, hard working, empathetic, caring, and always put the child's needs first. I have been babysitting for over 5 years now and I couldn't be happier. My skills include cooking, cleaning, helping with any responsibilities around the house, following a schedule for play time/naps, and attending to any activities with the child. I have my own transportation, I do not smoke/drink, and take my job very seriously. The most important concept is making sure the child is clean, happy, healthy, and safe. I enjoy creative arts, playing outside in nature, and reading books. Being patient and energetic are a couple of my strengths when taking care of a child. I fulfill my responsibilities 110% and make sure I performed accordingly to the situation. I also have a soft spot for animals. \r\nI have one cat of my own. Children I have taken care of range from the ages 6 months old to 10 years old.",
