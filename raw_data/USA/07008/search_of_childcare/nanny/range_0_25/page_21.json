While earning my degree, I worked as a tutor for grades K-8 at Mathnasium, training students on how to think and go about solving problems. \n\nI was also a volunteer for an after-school initiative called Creative Care, where I (alongside 5 other students) would develop and facilitate weekly creative wellness workshops for children in grades Pre K-8 at a center in the area near our campus.\n\nDuring my free time, I love to travel and experience new cultures. I've been to over 20 different countries, stretching over 5 of the 7 continents. \n\nIf my experience aligns with your families needs, I'd be happy to chat about the job!",
