Throughout high school, college, and currently I babysit for multiple families. The children range from 4 months to 10 years old.

She was very personable and nice to be around in our home. At first our boy was clingy and upset to be left with someone new, but by the end of her time with us he was very excited to see her when she arrived. She read him a lot of books, took him for walks and talked to him a lot, showing him things around the house and neighborhood. She even wrote a nice letter of tips and tricks for the new nanny, which showed how thoughtful she was. She was happy to take instructions and do things the way we ask. She kept us updated on the app that we use and by sending photos during the day. We appreciated having her help and were sad to see her go. ",

I'm comfortable caring for two children of any age group, and I have a car to assist with transportation.\n\nWith my CPR and First Aid certifications, you can trust that your children are in safe hands. I'm also willing to help with cooking, meal preparation, carpooling, light housekeeping, travel, and swimming supervision.\n\nI look forward to meeting you and your family and becoming a trusted part of your childcare support system.",
