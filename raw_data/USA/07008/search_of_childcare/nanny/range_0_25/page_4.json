My background & passion is in Mental Health & the arts. Right after college, I spent a few years working at Person Centered Care Services in Staten Island as a Direct Support Professional, teaching independent living skills to kids with special needs & developmental disorders. Following this, I was introduced to nannying and have worked with several families. I have a cat & I'm a huge dog lover. I enjoy being on the go & helping others.\n\nWith that being said, it's important to me that I work with a family that practices healthy relational dynamics & prioritizes the mental & emotional well-being of their children. If you have read this far, and feel that I might be a good match for your family, let's talk further.",

My previous babysitting roles have given me the opportunity to hone my skills in caring for children of all ages.\n\nI am known for my patient, calm, and creative approach, which allows me to engage children in imaginative play and activities. Open communication is essential, so I ensure regular updates on your child's day, either through verbal communication at pickup or via text or phone calls, whichever you prefer.\n\nWith my strong belief in consistency and structure, I am very comfortable enforcing household rules to ensure a harmonious and disciplined environment. From outdoor sports to board games and puzzles, I enjoy a wide range of activities that promote both physical and mental development.",
