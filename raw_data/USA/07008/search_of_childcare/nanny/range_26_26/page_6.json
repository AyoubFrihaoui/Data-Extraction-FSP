As a babysitter, I understand the importance of not only ensuring your child's safety but also contributing to their growth and happiness. I have a solid background in childcare, having babysat for several families over the past 3 years. Through my experience, I've cared for children of all ages, from infants to pre-teens, and have developed a strong understanding of their needs at every stage of development. What sets me apart is my personality. I am patient, compassionate, and highly responsible. My goal is to create a balance between fun and structure, ensuring your child is entertained. If you're looking for a babysitter who is not only responsible but also warm, energetic, and truly enjoys spending time with children, I'd love to help out. I look forward to the opportunity to care for your little ones and create a positive experience for both them and you!",

Growing up with 4 younger siblings, I was pretty much my mother's helper with everything. I have been in the child care business for the better side of 20 years working with ages from infant to 20 years old. I was also a preschool teacher for 2years and a ABA para professional for 4 years in NJ. I would love to meet with you to see if we are a great fit for each other.
