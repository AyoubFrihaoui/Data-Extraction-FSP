So that's a plus. I also was a teacher assistant with children age 2\nI'm very good at cooking, cleaning and even running errands as well. I've been a caretaker before, I was working with a young girl for some time. I've also had experience with senior care, I helped out my grandmother for sometime.

I am a NJ certified pre-k through 3rd grade teacher and have worked with many different age groups. Last summer, I went to different daycares and camps to teach different sports and activities to all ages. I have always loved working with children and make sure every child is happy. I bring a lot of enthusiasm and creativity to my work. During these times I also make sure to be very safe and cautious. I limit my exposure to seeing other people and going out. I always wear a face mask and keep a safe distance.",
