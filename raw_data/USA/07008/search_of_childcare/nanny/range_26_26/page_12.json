Since I was born and raised in Staten Island, I had the privilege of getting a wonderful education from St. Joseph Hill Academy High School before I went away! I have worked with children my entire life, from being an assistant instructor at my martial arts dojo, to working at Sunrise Day Camp for three summers! I love babysitting because children bring me joy. Every time you hear them laugh about something, or even when they do something that could be perceived as silly, it brightens your life a little bit more! Other than babysitting, I've also volunteered at the Brooklyn VA hospital, worked with children and adults who have special needs, and tutored Psychopharmacology and History at my Alma mater! I'm also an animal lover! I've had an aquarium for four years, and I'm taking home a poodle puppy in a few weeks!",
