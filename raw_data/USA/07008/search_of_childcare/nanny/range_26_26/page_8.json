I love to create fun and exciting activities for children to do, as seeing a smile on a someone's face brings me such joy. I have a background of babysitting children of all ages, infants to young teens, both male and female. During my time babysitting, I have been responsible for tutoring, driving children around, preparing food, and creating a fun and safe environment. Additionally, as part of my studies in high school I took a course called Tomorrow's Teachers, which gave me the opportunity to work with many different students, ranging from first to sixth grade. I am a recent college graduate with an accounting degree. On campus I was involved in a club that focuses on aiding battered women and their children, which I very involved in.",
