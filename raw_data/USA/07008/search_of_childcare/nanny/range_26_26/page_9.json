I enjoy every little thing about children from play time to their learning abilities. I am in school right now for Early Childhood Education. I am aspiring to own my own day care someday. I started out babysitting my family members' children, to babysitting around my neighborhood and have been working in day care centers since. I'm hardworking, flexible, and very punctual and I have my own vehicle. I look forward to meeting you and your family. Thank you.",
