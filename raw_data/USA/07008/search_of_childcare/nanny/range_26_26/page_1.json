I have worked as a nanny for multiple families, staying with each for three years or more, as well as working in preschools and daycares.\n\nI provide engaging activities throughout the day, including coloring, reading, singing, and developmental play. My childcare includes teaching important milestones such as crawling, sitting up, walking, talking, and potty training. Weather permitting, I love to take children outside for walks, park visits, etc.\n\nMy experience includes caring for infants through elementary-aged children, which also includes twins and children with special needs. I provide patience, and loving care for each child's unique needs. I have excellent references from families I provided loving care for.",
