I have custody of three children for about four years, 1 niece and 2 nephews, 1 has ADHD, but I have raised them since they were babies. I cook well, I clean well, and I love reading bedtime stories and singing, playing and dancing with children. Children are never to young to learn, that's why I love to implement age appropriate arts and crafts, or any other learning ideas that are fun and exciting. When children smile and laugh it brings complete joy to my heart knowing that I'm bringing joy to theirs. I am a quick learner, so whatever I can't do I can learn with no problems. I love to converse and share past stories and future goals. I love to help inspire, motivate, teach, and encourage children of all ages. Anything else I will be pleased to share. Thank you for your consideration, and I hope to become a part of your family.",

I started babysitting at 16 years old for 2 families to help them when their kids came home after school. I have experience with all ages groups and I'm also great with pets. I can help with light house work, vacuuming, laundry, dishes etc. I can also provide you with feed back from families that I have worked for, they will let you know I'm extremely reliable, responsible, fun and I can also think outside of the box to keep your children entertained! I speak three languages, English, Portuguese, and Spanish. If you think I will suite your needs please do not hesitate to contact me! Can't wait to hear from you, have a great day!!",
