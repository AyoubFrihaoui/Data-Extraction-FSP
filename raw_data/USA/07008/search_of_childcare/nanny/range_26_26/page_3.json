In addition to my childcare expertise, I am also an artist. I believe in the power of creativity and self-expression. Whether it's through painting, crafting, or imaginative play, I strive to inspire children to explore their creativity while developing their cognitive and motor skills.

I also do house work; such as clean, laundry, food preparation and pick ups and drops offs. My main purpose is to make life just a little bit easier for you. Anything I can do to make things easier, I am willing to do. I am willing to nanny at your home or at my place. Whichever you are comfortable with. I am looking for something full time and I am willing to provide references. I am COVID Vaccinated and I have the booster. I am CPR certified & have background in early childhood education. I have worked with children who have special needs & have worked with kids from ages 2 weeks to 19 years old! Hopefully I can be the right fit for your family.

When it comes to childcare, there's so much stress, so it's nice when the person you hire doesn't add to that stress. One time I had her come watch my 2 boys while I tidied the house and ran some errands. I didn't have to explain or prompt her with what to do, like I have had to with other babysitters. She took charge, played with the boys, and they had the best time. We have recently moved. For awhile, we were back & forth between 2 states. We kept our dog in SI for a few weeks, and she was super helpful watching the dog, feeding, walking, etc. I really wish we had found her sooner. She always had a smile, there was never any drama, and the boys loved her. I should also mention that I have a 3 and 5 year old: 2 boys who are very rambunctious. The 5 year old has epilepsy. This is something that was a deterrent to many applicants. I told Liana about his epilepsy, medication, seizures, and what to do, during the interview. She felt confident that she could handle it. In addition, there were days she had to watch the boys from 5:30am-9 or 10pm, and she did so with no issues. I would hire her again in a heartbeat.",

I believe in open and honest communication with parents and always follow their preferred method to ensure we're on the same page about their child's well-being and progress.\n\nWhen it comes to enforcing household rules, I firmly believe in following the parents' lead and maintaining consistency. This approach helps children understand boundaries and fosters a sense of respect and responsibility.\n\nMy love for interactive play extends to board games and puzzles, which not only entertain but also enhance children's problem-solving and cognitive skills.",

I live in Tottenville and I have experience with 16-month-olds to 12-year-old school children. I have cared for high functioning autistic children. I also have experience tutoring/ homework help for Pre-Kindergarten to sixth grade students. I love animals especially rodents, dogs and cats. I'm a non smoker and I have no issues with transportation. I can assist with Light Housekeeping and Cooking/Meal Preparation. I love babysitting and nannying because I'm able to form bonds and connections with each family and child I get the privilege of meeting. With my skills I can ensure that each child I care for will be provided with a safe and loving environment. I'm willing to accommodate to any parenting styles/ lifestyle choices you've established thus far. I hope you consider me to care for your child.",
