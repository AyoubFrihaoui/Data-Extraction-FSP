Love above all because when you love children you simply take care of them as if they were yours and instinctively you protect them and give them the best of you. Followed by all the activities they have, their physical and personal development. I really like activities outside the home such as taking the children to parks, library, music classes, sports and also activities inside the house such as painting, art and craft, reading books, homework and many other things. Help with children's clothes and healthy meals. I hope to have the opportunity to find a new family with whom to start a new chapter of my life with a lot of love!",

Although I solely enjoy both performing arts and visual arts with children, I've grown to love sports as well. My childcare experience began 14 years ago, at age 14. I started off caring for my younger siblings until they were old enough to care for themselves. As the years progressed, I continued to care for the children within my family. Professionally, I began to working at a local daycare for approximately 2 and a half years, which is where I discovered my passion for caring for children. I've worked with children from the ages of 3 months to 12 years old, including children with special needs. My position was a \"teacher's aid/assistant.\" My main duties were to maintain classroom cleanliness, make sure all babies were changed/fed, engage in activities with all students, and enforce learning skills in the classrooms.",

My background in early childhood education, coupled with my friendly and patient nature, allows me to connect easily with children and create a nurturing environment. I believe in open communication with parents and will promptly address any concerns or updates regarding their child's day.\n\nWhen it comes to enforcing household rules, I'm very comfortable doing so in a gentle yet firm manner. I understand the importance of consistency and structure for children, and I work closely with parents to ensure their expectations are met.\n\nMy approach to childcare is holistic and engaging. I love playing outdoor sports and physical games with children, as well as board games and puzzles. I also encourage imaginative play and am always up for a good adventure.\n\nIn addition to my childcare experience, I'm proficient in English and Spanish, and I'm certified in First Aid and CPR.",
