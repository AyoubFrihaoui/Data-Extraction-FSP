As for household rules, I follow the parents' lead to ensure consistency for the child.\n\nFrom board games and puzzles to educational games that promote learning and technology-based games and apps, I enjoy a variety of games that cater to different interests and age groups. I'm comfortable caring for up to three children, ranging from infants to preteens.\n\nWith some college education and certifications in CPR training and First Aid, I'm confident in my ability to provide a safe and nurturing environment for your child.",

I worked primarily with children from infancy to primary age (about 6/7 years old). But I love all ages! I'm Adult and Pediatric CPR, AED, and First Aid certified by the Red Cross. My college degree is Early Childhood Education/Family Studies and I'm also a certified parent educator and passed the INA Nanny Basic Skills Assessment. I'm also a mama to a sweet 3-year-old little boy! \n\nI love to stay active so I'm hoping to work with a family who loves adventures and the outdoors. I also love arts and crafts (and do many Waldorf based activities), reading, and baking. I love working with children and seeing them blossom into their own person. My background in Montessori has taught me great respect for children and their abilities and therefore I think children should have their needs met and their voices heard.",

I am passionate about children because you can learn a lot from them, like how to enjoy the simple things in life. I have been working with children for the past 5 years in the position of babysitters, nanny and daycare assistant. I have worked with all ages from newborn to 15 years old. I love working with children and getting to know them and their individual personalities. Interactive choices and empowering others to be confident in their own freewill while still being respectful and honoring of those around them is key & helping them as they grow and face new challenges in school and life in general. I have worked with children in several different countries through relief work and various mission trips. I have a passion for childcare that I can not ignore. kids are simply my favorite to be around never a dull moment.",

During that time, I played, provided meals, performed varying activities with children in addition to anything possible to help out the family. These children have ranged from 6 months to 12 years of age.\nI have also worked as a mother's helper to a family with a special needs child. During that time I looked over a 7-year-old boy with autism while his parents were busy, attended doctor's appointments, speech therapy sessions, and performed arts and crafts activities with the child. \nI am a graduate of the SUNY New Paltz Speech-Pathology department with a minor in linguistics. Upon my graduation, I was offered a position working as a teacher's assistant at a university in Spain. In addition to working at the university, I taught private tutor sessions to children ranging from 6 years of age to 16. I also looked over these children when their parents were unable to do so. I will be starting a master's degree at Long Island University in September of this year. I will still be able to work during that time. \nI am a very responsible, fun-loving, flexible individual. Please feel free to contact me.",
