I have experience working with children through a number of my volunteer roles and work including babysitting. I am in my second year of college majoring in psychology. I speak Fluent English and Spanish!\n\n I really cherish the moments where I can help families support a child's growth. Just like children learn a lot from us we can learn just as much from them. I love tapping into my inner child and seeing the joy on their faces after every accomplishment. I love working with kids because it allows you to see growth and progress in amazing, measurable ways. \n\nI'd describe my personality as gentle, charismatic, outgoing and nurturing. In my spare time I like to go on runs , paint, as well as read, and watch the sunset on the beach!\n\nSome of my valued skills are CPR certified , organization, planning , and creativity!",
