I enjoy spending my time with children. I have participated in child development classes throughout my highschool years where I have gained college credits. Later on I began to work in a daycare for about 3 years. That's when I started to be an assistant teacher and later was promoted to become a lead teacher. I very much enjoyed my time as a teacher in the daycare and many of the students were sad when it was time to go and move on to my next chapter in life, but while I was teaching I also babysat some students in my class. Me and the kids would do fun and safe activities at home while the parents were out working/running errands. I'd like to think of myself as outgoing, adventurous and compassionate. Whenever I get the pleasure to be in the care of your child/children I will always make sure to put their safety first!!",
