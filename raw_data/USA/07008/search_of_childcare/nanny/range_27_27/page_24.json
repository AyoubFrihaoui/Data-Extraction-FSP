I am always interacting with the child as much as I can and will always have activities and crafts ready to keep things fun and productive. I love reading and singing songs / dancing with the children. I am experienced in homework help as well as teaching younger children their ABC's and 123's in fun and creative ways.

My passion lies in fostering their growth and development, while providing reliable support to families. I have two kids with autism so that gives me a lot of experience with special needs children. \n\nI consider myself a patient and calm person, which helps me maintain a formal and reserved demeanor in any situation. \n\nWhen it comes to communicating with parents, I prefer verbal communication at pickup, but I'm always open to following their preferred method of communication.\n\nI'm fluent in both English and Spanish, and I have my CPR and First Aid certifications. I also have a car, so transportation is not an issue.",
