I believe open and honest communication is key, so I'll keep parents updated about their child's day and any issues that arise.\n\nI'm very comfortable enforcing household rules, and I love playing all sorts of games with children, including outdoor sports, board games, and educational games. I'm also happy to help with cooking, meal preparation, light housekeeping, and swimming supervision.\n\nI'm available to care for up to three children of any age group.
