My experience includes being a nanny for a beautiful family with 3 children ages 4-7 and previously babysitting children ages 2-12. I am currently a full time nanny for a family residing in Westfield, children 7 months and 4 years old! (Baby is now almost 16 months). I also am a part time nanny for a second family in Westfield as well, children 7 months and 4 years old (baby is now 16 months). Babysitting and being with children comes naturally to me as I come from a very large family. I love helping babies learn to walk, reading and helping language development, and sensory/educational play. I love crafts, cooking/baking, playing outdoors, sports, reading, movie nights and overall having a fun time with children! I'm extremely friendly, fun, positive and easy going and most kids I know warm up to me real fast :). \n\nI am open on weekends whether it's an every week schedule or a date night out! I look forward to hearing from you and your family.",
