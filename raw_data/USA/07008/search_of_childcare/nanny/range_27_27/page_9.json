Growing up as the oldest of four children, I developed a nurturing spirit and a love for caring for others, particularly children. My grandmother owned a daycare in our community, and from the age of 10 to 16, I helped her after school. This early experience provided me with a solid foundation in childcare, which I've built upon through various roles in daycare centers, nannying, and babysitting. I also have many references and a detailed resume available upon request.\n\nAs a child, I found that my energetic and joyful personality naturally attracted children. I believe in creating an instant connection with the kids I care for, making them feel safe, loved, and supported. I'm passionate about providing children with an environment where they can grow, learn, and thrive. I strive to be a part of their journey, offering emotional support, happiness, and a sense of security.",

Working as an Elementary School Teacher for the past 7 years, plus over 10 years of childcare experience has opened my eyes and heart to children's needs-- academically, socially, and emotionally. \n\nI absolutely love what I do and wish to broaden its impact through tutoring and childcare. I also hope to use my passion to help families establish normalcy during this uncertain time by providing individualized care and/or instruction. \n\nSome of my favorite tutoring subjects and activities include reading comprehension, writing, math, science, social studies, organization, study habits, and test-taking preparation.\n\nIn childcare positions, I love arts & crafts, exploring nature, games, imaginative play/theatre, building, developing communication skills, and working on whatever goals the parents have set for their child(ren). \n\nHope to hear from you soon!\nCorinne",

Her nurturing and caring nature has made a profound impact on our family, and we are incredibly grateful for the time she has spent with us. From the beginning, Corrine demonstrated a deep commitment to our daughter’s well-being and development. She collaborated with us to create and implement monthly curriculum and provided thorough, insightful reports on our daughter's progress. Her support extended beyond childcare; she helped with housekeeping and took initiative to ease our workload. Her suggestions regarding meal planning, as well as her creative ideas for activities like arts and crafts, water play, and outings to the park, library, and neighborhood walks, were greatly appreciated. Her Montessori-inspired approach to fostering our daughter’s development and independence transformed our space into a mini classroom, offering a limitless learning experience. Corrine has provided exceptional care and support, and we highly recommend her to any family looking for someone dedicated and skilled. ",

I've had many positive experiences in babysitting roles, and I know I can make a positive impact on your children's lives. I'm patient, calm, creative, imaginative, friendly, and approachable. I'm also very comfortable enforcing household rules.\n\nI communicate regularly with parents about their child's day, both verbally at pickup and through written daily reports. I'm also happy to provide updates via text or phone call if there are any issues that arise.\n\nI love playing all sorts of games with children, including outdoor sports and physical games, board games and puzzles, and educational games that promote learning. I have experience caring for children of all ages, from infants to teenagers, and I'm comfortable caring for one child at a time. I also speak both English and Spanish.",
