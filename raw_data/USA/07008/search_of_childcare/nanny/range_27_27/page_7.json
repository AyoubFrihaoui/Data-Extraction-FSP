As a patient, creative, and friendly caregiver, I prioritize open communication with parents through regular updates and verbal discussions during pickup.\n\nI'm particularly comfortable enforcing household rules and ensuring the safety of the children in my care. My approach to childcare involves a variety of engaging activities, including outdoor sports, educational games, and board games. I firmly believe that play is essential for a child's development and learning.\n\nI hold a valid CPR and First Aid certification, and I am comfortable caring for up to three children of various age groups.

I have had experience with children ages 1month to 12 years old. When I was younger I watched 4 children on a daily basis when they came home from school until 8:00 p.m.  I helped them with thier homework, fed them dinner, bathed the children, and put them in bed. I would also babysit on the weekends for a family who had a son with special needs. I helped with all of the above and made sure he recieved all of his medication. I also have experience watching my younger sister and younger cousins. I am a certified nursing assistant, have been working in the hospital for a year. I am majoring in nursing wanting to be a RN for pediatrics. I enjoy working with kids and helping them in any way I could. I still continue to have exprience with children babysitting",

Working as an Elementary School Teacher for the past 7 years, plus over 10 years of childcare experience has opened my eyes and heart to children's needs-- academically, socially, and emotionally. \n\nI absolutely love what I do and wish to broaden its impact through tutoring and childcare. I also hope to use my passion to help families establish normalcy during this uncertain time by providing individualized care and/or instruction. \n\nSome of my favorite tutoring subjects and activities include reading comprehension, writing, math, science, social studies, organization, study habits, and test-taking preparation.\n\nIn childcare positions, I love arts & crafts, exploring nature, games, imaginative play/theatre, building, developing communication skills, and working on whatever goals the parents have set for their child(ren). \n\nHope to hear from you soon!\nCorinne",

Her nurturing and caring nature has made a profound impact on our family, and we are incredibly grateful for the time she has spent with us. From the beginning, Corrine demonstrated a deep commitment to our daughter’s well-being and development. She collaborated with us to create and implement monthly curriculum and provided thorough, insightful reports on our daughter's progress. Her support extended beyond childcare; she helped with housekeeping and took initiative to ease our workload. Her suggestions regarding meal planning, as well as her creative ideas for activities like arts and crafts, water play, and outings to the park, library, and neighborhood walks, were greatly appreciated. Her Montessori-inspired approach to fostering our daughter’s development and independence transformed our space into a mini classroom, offering a limitless learning experience. Corrine has provided exceptional care and support, and we highly recommend her to any family looking for someone dedicated and skilled. ",

I'm fully COVID-19 vaccinated and boosted, and I hold a CPR certification. My experience ranges from caring for infants as young as 2 months to teenagers up to 15 years old, including those on the autism spectrum. I've also managed overnight care.\n\nI decided to become a caregiver because I find joy in building relationships with children and ensuring their safety. Being part of a family's team brings me immense happiness. I'm excited about the opportunity to meet your little bundle of joy!\n\nIn addition to childcare, I can cook, help with housekeeping, and assist with potty training. I'm flexible and available for various tasks around the house, including last-minute date nights on most occasions.\n\nFeel free to contact me anytime.

I have previously lived and worked in Chicago and London while studying my undergraduate degree in Social Policy and my master's degree in Human Rights. I take a holistic approach when caring for children through activity-based learning, socio-emotional development, and freedom of expression. I have cared for children in many capacities including one-on-one care for unique children ranging from baby-13 years old, after-school programming and coordination for middle schoolers, group tutoring for 3rd graders, and as a bilingual trauma-informed social services coordinator.",
