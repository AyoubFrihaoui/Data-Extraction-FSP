I believe in open communication with parents and will provide regular updates on your child's day. I follow the parents' preferred communication method, whether that's verbal communication at pickup or regular updates via text or phone call.\n\nIn addition to childcare, I'm happy to help with cooking, meal preparation, and light housekeeping.",
