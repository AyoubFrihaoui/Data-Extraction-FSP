I am intelligent, have excellent common sense and will get to know your child or children well enough to be a step above the rest provider. I am patient, compassionate and love the outdoors, do crafts, play games and I am always interested in learning about things I am a little unfamiliar with. I am a Jersey girl. I have basically traveled all over New Jersey for my school jobs and part-time positions. I have 2 boys of my own, one is 22 and in the army stationed in Kentucky and my other son works for the prosecutors office doing all their websites. I enjoy all the seasons and the change of weather. I like to be outside as much as possible, weather permitting. I don't mind driving too much, don't enjoy getting stuck in the traffic, but who does? I have done other things before I worked with children. I was a credit reporter in NY and was a customer service rep. I work till 2:40 everyday, looking for part-time work.",

I know what it takes to have a baby on schedule, adopt an organizing daily schedule for older kids, prepare meals, help with school work, and enjoy recreational activities with them. I tend to be very creative and a NO TV NANNY... I look for activities to occupy the kids and other creative ways to keep their active minds going. It is for these reasons that I consistently receive outstanding feedback from families I have worked with in the past.\n\nIn the last five years alone, I have done babysitting for a number of families on part time basis and worked as a live-in nanny for two years and live-out nanny for three years with the family I am currently serving. I am a young lady full of talent. I am great at cooking as well as event planning. I have used such skills in helping kids I work with to stay on point in their school work, their rooms, and their daily schedule. I have also used my skills to assist parents work",
