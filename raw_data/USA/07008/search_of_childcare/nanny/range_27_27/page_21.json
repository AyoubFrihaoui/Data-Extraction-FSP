From infants to preteens, I reveled in the joy of watching each child grow and thrive under my care. There's something magical about witnessing the milestones of learning, and tutoring in between has only deepened my appreciation.\nOutgoing, energetic, and empathetic are the pillars of my approach, allowing me to connect with children on a level that's engaging and reassuring. My strength lies in my patience and my\nability to communicate, ensuring that every child feels valued and understood. \nI'm well-versed in keeping toddlers safe and school-aged children entertained without the crutch of screen time. My goal is to foster an environment where creativity and curiosity flourish.\nMy experience with working with children of all ages has taught me that every child is a world unto themselves, deserving of patience,\nunderstanding, and support.",

I've been providing childcare to tons of loving families for the past 4 years, through my job (gymnastic coach & daycare/summer camp counselor) as well as babysitting! I also am a full time college student majoring in pediatric psychology! I am CPR & first aid certified. I love helping families and making a positive impact on children's lives. I'm patient and calm with a creative and imaginative nature, I'm also very comfortable with enforcing household rules. I have experience caring for children of all ages from infants to teens! as well as caring for up to four children at a time. I enjoy playing sports, board games, puzzles, and educational games with children. I'm extremely comfortable communicating with parents about their child's day and any issues that arise, and I follow their preferred communication method. I firmly believe that open and honest communication is key to building trust with families.",
