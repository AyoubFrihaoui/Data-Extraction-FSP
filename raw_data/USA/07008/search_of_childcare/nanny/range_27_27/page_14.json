Witnessing the positive impact I had on children's lives fueled my desire to make a meaningful difference in their development. I'm motivated by the opportunity to support families and provide a reliable childcare option that allows parents peace of mind.\n\nMy approach to childcare is centered around patience, creativity, and a friendly demeanor. I believe in establishing a nurturing environment where children feel safe and encouraged to explore their imaginations. Open communication is key, and I ensure parents are well-informed about their child's day through verbal communication at pickup. I'm also very comfortable enforcing household rules to maintain a structured and harmonious environment.\n\nWhen it comes to activities, I enjoy engaging children in a variety of games and experiences.",

Prior to my medical career, I worked as a professor as well as an ABA therapist. \n\nPrior to my medical career I was a competitive dancer and enjoyed other forms of art.
