My calm and creative personality allows me to engage with children effectively and foster a sense of trust and comfort.\n\nI believe in open communication and regular updates to parents about their child's day and any concerns that arise. I'm also very comfortable enforcing household rules to ensure a structured and safe environment.\n\nMy days with children are filled with a variety of fun activities, including outdoor games, board games, puzzles, and educational games that promote learning and development. I'm also comfortable caring for children of all ages, from infants to preteens.\n\nI'm fluent in both English and Spanish, and I have a car, so transportation is not an issue.
