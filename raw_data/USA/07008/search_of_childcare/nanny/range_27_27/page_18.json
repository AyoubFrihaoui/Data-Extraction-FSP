I'm patient, calm, and creative, and I love finding new and engaging ways to help children learn and grow. I'm also experienced in enforcing household rules in a gentle and consistent manner.\n\nI believe in open and transparent communication with parents and am happy to provide written daily reports or regular updates via text or phone, whichever method the parents prefer.
