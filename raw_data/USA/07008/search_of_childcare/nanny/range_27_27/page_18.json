My journey into caregiving began as an assistant teacher at a daycare and occasionally consists of babysitting roles, which sparked my desire to make a positive impact on young lives. I've gained valuable experience caring for children of various ages, and I'm comfortable looking after up to many children at a time, due to experiences as a teacher. I prioritize open communication with parents. I believe in providing regular updates about their child's day and promptly addressing any concerns or issues that arise, using the parents' preferred communication method. I'm also very comfortable enforcing household rules and ensuring a safe and structured environment for the children in my care.\n\nMy approach to childcare is centered around creativity and imagination. I enjoy engaging children in outdoor sports and physical games, as well as board games and puzzles.",

I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Philosophy, Politics & Economics with a concentration in Choice & Behavior. I have worked with kids for 9 years and absolutely love it!! Specifically, I founded a nonprofit organization in 2015 to offer educational opportunities to young children in Nigeria. Beyond this extensive experience, I have also babysat for many families in the Union County area. I like to consider myself a multifaceted individual, with my interests and hobbies ranging from working out, reading, cooking, singing, dancing, entrepreneurship & fashion design and anything creative / art related. I am also pursuing a professional career in law! My goal is to leave a positive mark on those I cross paths with, showing them that the tools to become their best selves are already within them, and that all your dreams are achievable! I look forward to meeting your families and hanging out with your children.",

I currently work part time with a family I have been with since 2021 and watch their 2 children, a boy and a girl ages 9 and 11. Not too long ago, I worked for another family and watched their three young sons, ages 2, 4, and 5 and a half. I also cared for a young baby one summer, aged 6 months and sometimes aided in watching his brothers, aged 3 and 5. In addition to these jobs, I have worked here and there for parents on nights out, errand runs, or any other small one time thing. I have also received certifications in CPR and first aid! I am very comfortable with pets as I have had my own my whole life and also do some pet sitting in my area. I am also happy to help with light housekeeping if needed.

I have completed a certification course in Early Years Supervision for Child Development.\n\nWith over five years of experience in babysitting and caring for children of various ages, I bring a dedicated and compassionate approach to childcare.
