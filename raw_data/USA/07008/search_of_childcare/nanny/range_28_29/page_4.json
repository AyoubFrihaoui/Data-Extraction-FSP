The last family I worked with was a full time M-F 6am-4 p.m.  Caring for a 15-month-old and a 3-year-old. Duties included wake up, breakfast, nap time, changing, etc. Prior to that, I my work was also a full day 8am-5 p.m.  with a 15month old, I was responsible for all meals, bottle making, changing, nap time routine, etc. \n I am also CPR and first aide certified, as well as my life guard certification. I am extremely reliable, caring, and have a flexible schedule with my own car and a clean driving record. I would love to talk more about possibly meeting and helping your family out. I can provide references if needed. Looking forward to hearing from you! \nThank you!",

My experience includes written daily reports and regular updates to parents via text or phone call.\n\nWhen it comes to play, I enjoy engaging children with board games, puzzles, and technology-based games and apps. I'm also a skilled swimmer and would love to teach your children how to swim, if you'd like!\n\nI hold a graduate degree and am certified in CPR and First Aid. I'm also fluent in English and Spanish.

Along with being a Graphic Design major, I am also a photographer. I absolutely love kids and I enjoy taking care of them. I really don't see it as a job because I have a good time doing it. My child care style is pretty easy going. I like to form a bond with the children and have fun. I have babysat for many families but one I have worked for 8 years. I have stayed over their house, gone on vacations with and assisted with family parties. I have also gotten child ready for school and gotten him off the bus on many occasions. I have experience with multiples as well as infants. I am also CPR certified!",
