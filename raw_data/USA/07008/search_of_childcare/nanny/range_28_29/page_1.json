I've worked with children ranging from 4 months to 14 years old, helping to support their growth, development, and learning at every stage. \n\nAs I seek a full-time childcare position, I'm looking forward to bringing my experience, attention to detail, and dedication to a family where I can create a safe and engaging environment. \n\nIf you're looking for a reliable, responsible, and experienced caregiver, I'd love to connect and discuss how I can support your family's needs!",
