I hope to find a family that allows me to make their everyday life a little easier. I look forward to speaking with you all! \n\nI'd describe my personality as funny, positive & energetic.\n\nI like working with kids because I grew up in a family surrounded by children.\n\nI'm looking for a job that allows me to care for others. \n\nI started working with kids when I was a teenager, I volunteered as a cheerleading coach. I also worked with children as part of a fundraising program through my previous job. Now I'm a mother of a 5-month-old and a aunt to four little boys under 2.\n\nIn my spare time, I like to spend time with my son & create memories everyday.\n\nOne thing you should know about me is that I will give my all to whatever I set my mind to. \n\nMy skills include being patient, thoughtful & kind.",
