In my current and past jobs I had a variety of duties ranging from changing diapers, feeding, nap time, potty training, to grocery shopping, running errands or pick up/drop offs. I have a lot of fun with the kids I take care of. I enjoy bringing them to the park, going for strolls around the neighborhood or doing a bunch of other outdoor and indoor activities. I am capable of light cooking, cleaning or homework help and I am willing to help out all around. You can rely on me to always be there and treat your child/children as if they were one of my own.
