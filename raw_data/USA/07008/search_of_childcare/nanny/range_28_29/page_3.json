I am a very sweet, caring, trustworthy and reliable person. I have a passion for children and I truly enjoy being with them. I have experience with kids ranging from 5 months old to 12 years old. In my current and past jobs I had a variety of duties ranging from changing diapers, feeding, nap time, potty training, to grocery shopping, running errands or pick up/drop offs. I have a lot of fun with the kids I take care of. I enjoy bringing them to the park, going for strolls around the neighborhood or doing a bunch of other outdoor and indoor activities. I am capable of light cooking, cleaning or homework help and I am willing to help out all around. You can rely on me to always be there and treat your child/children as if they were one of my own.

I have experience with adapting age appropriate activities and enjoy finding those nearest to you. I worked full time at an educational childcare facility on the UES and have gained valuable knowledge on child based play for infants and toddlers. I now work full time as a foster care social worker and babysit whenever I have time to do so. I adore kids and animals, if you have pets that is not a problem! I can help with cooking preparation and light housekeeping. I enjoy helping others and can answer any questions about my experience or references.",

I also volunteered at a summer program during my high school years when I was a teacher assistant and worked with 1 1/2-4-year-old kids in a classroom setting. I am full of energy to help with a child's daily schedule and understand the importance of the development of these early years in their life.

I believe in fostering a nurturing environment where children feel safe and encouraged to explore their interests.\n\nCommunication is key, and I keep parents regularly updated on their child's day, either through verbal communication at pickup or via text or phone calls, whichever the parents prefer. As for household rules, I follow the parents' lead to ensure consistency and respect for their parenting style.",

I have been sitting for multiple families for nearly four years now on occasional, date night, and regular schedule. I have nearly 5+ years experience with nannying/sitting ages ranging from 3 months - 11 years old. The last family I worked with was a full time M-F 6am-4 p.m.  Caring for a 15-month-old and a 3-year-old. Duties included wake up, breakfast, nap time, changing, etc. Prior to that, I my work was also a full day 8am-5 p.m.  with a 15month old, I was responsible for all meals, bottle making, changing, nap time routine, etc. \n I am also CPR and first aide certified, as well as my life guard certification. I am extremely reliable, caring, and have a flexible schedule with my own car and a clean driving record. I would love to talk more about possibly meeting and helping your family out. I can provide references if needed. Looking forward to hearing from you! \nThank you!",
