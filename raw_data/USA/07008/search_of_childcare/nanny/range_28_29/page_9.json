I have a bachelor's degree from the University of North Florida and enjoy reading, hiking, traveling, and playing board games in my spare time. I feel honored that I'm able to work with children and help families out for a living. I'm very patient, thoughtful, understanding, and reliable when it comes to being a nanny. \n\nI am currently working part-time with my current family until June.

I occasionally watch all four of my nieces and nephews on weekends, taking them to the park and other activities . During my teenage years, for about five years or more I watched over and accompanied my special needs brother to school activities and assisted him with daily care. Furthermore I work as a nurse assistant at a hospital assisting patients in daily care and so much more. I am CPR certified as well as being trained in Choking first aid. I'm available in the evenings to assist your child in activities, keep your place tidy, help with homework as needed and of course daily care such as dressing and feeding. No matter the occasion, whether the parents need a date night or just an extra hand to keep the kids busy, I'm there. Don't hesitate to ask any questions. \n\nI'd describe my personality as friendly, dedicated and accountable",
