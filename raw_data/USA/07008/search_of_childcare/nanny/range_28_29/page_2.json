I have a Bachelors of Science in Music and I have a very unique experience teaching that can be a great asset for your family this year. Not only have I been teaching private music lessons for about 20 years (both in person and remotely) but I have also been teaching children from ages 3-18 in some capacity or another for nearly 20 years. Other than a regular classroom setting where children are grouped by grade and age, I also have experience working with multiple children of varying ages and levels at the same time. Due to the Pandemic, I worked at a REC center this past Spring where each teacher had a classroom full of children of all different ages (K-5th grade). The combination of distance learning and the physical classroom gave me many unique tools to use so I can teach and enrich children's lives while keeping them safe and healthy.",
