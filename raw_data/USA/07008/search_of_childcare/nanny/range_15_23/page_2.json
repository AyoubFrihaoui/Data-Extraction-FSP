After graduating high school I began college and working at a charter school in Jersey City where I became an assistant teacher for 1st and 2nd grade. I also had the opportunity to babysit my former high school math teachers children after school hours and on weekends. Last May I was blessed with my baby girl, being a first time mother has been nothing but great. I have many years of experience with children. I am very patient, loving and reliable.
