At first our boy was clingy and upset to be left with someone new, but by the end of her time with us he was very excited to see her when she arrived. She read him a lot of books, took him for walks and talked to him a lot, showing him things around the house and neighborhood. She even wrote a nice letter of tips and tricks for the new nanny, which showed how thoughtful she was. She was happy to take instructions and do things the way we ask. She kept us updated on the app that we use and by sending photos during the day. We appreciated having her help and were sad to see her go. ",

We always think that we are the ones teaching kids, but I've come to realize that kids also teach us a lot about life! Letting us into their world is a privilege I don't take lightly. I drive, and am comfortable running errands or helping with chores, heating up/making simple meals or any other tasks that you need assistance with besides your munchkin!\n\nI believe care. com performs a background check, but it's my church policy to run a background check on anyone who is volunteering and I have a copy from a year-year and a half ago that I'd be willing to share. \n\nReferences available upon request and feel free to ask any questions!

Ever since I was a kid I took theater classes run by my mom who created her own little theater school. I took this class though childhood, it taught me the value of presence and creating your own way of life. Within this experience, I saw how much of an impact she had on all sorts of kids, and I gathered her sincere skill (AKA- to truly care about the well-being and ultimate presence of people who are not yet adults) wanted to share this with people wherever I work... I have plenty of experience within counseling, babysitting, music, theater, film, play. I am super flexible and can meet you and your family's needs!",
