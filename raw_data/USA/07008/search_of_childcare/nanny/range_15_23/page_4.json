My journey into caregiving began with fulfilling babysitting roles, which solidified my desire to make a positive impact on children's development.\n\nI am a patient, creative, and friendly individual who believes in fostering a nurturing environment for children to thrive. Effective communication is key, so I ensure regular updates and follow the parents' preferred communication method to keep them informed about their child's day.\n\nEnforcing household rules comes naturally to me, and I have experience caring for one child at a time. In terms of activities, I enjoy engaging children in outdoor sports, board games, puzzles, and educational games that stimulate their learning.\n\nMy educational background includes some college coursework, and I have completed First Aid and CPR training. I currently work as a lead prek3 teacher in cranford!",

I also have recent experience with infants as a surrogate mother and was fortunate enough to have cared for this child for two months. \n\nIn my free time I enjoy running outside and feeling fresh air on my face, reading as many books as I possibly can, and I love to paint. \n\nI am looking for full time employment but could be open to part time as well. I am passionate about family values and spending time with children giving them undivided attention. \n\nI am open to a nanny setting where I come in the house care for children, help with cooking, cleaning, prepping for school or sports or anything that is going on. I am available to provide transportation as needed. We will enjoy time at home, along with any additional extracurriculars and/or approved outings.",
