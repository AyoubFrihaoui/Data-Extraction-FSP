I love to always incorporate some kind of educational lesson in everything I do while having fun of course. I love science experiments, crafts, and tons of dancing but love a good book and movie as well. I have working with children since I was 16 years old starting as a camp counselor for the YMCA. I have my associates in Early Childhood Education and currently working for the Perth Amboy Board of Education for the past 7 years. I have however worked with special needs children for the past 12 years. I am CPR/ First Aid Certified. I also am the assistant coach for the High School Varsity Softball Team. Currently finishing my bachelors in Child Development (within the next year) and Registered Behavioral Technician Certificate (within the next two weeks).",
