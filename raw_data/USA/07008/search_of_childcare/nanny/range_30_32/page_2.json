Since I was young, I have dedicated my life to caring for children, as an older sister to 2 girls, a nanny and babysitter, and a full-time mom to my 4-year-old son. I have raised a great kid, who loves math and engages in Montessori. Now with my son in school, I am seeking a new opportunity (ideally 3 full days) to nurture and care for children, providing them with the love and compassion they deserve. \n\nI am easy going and don't let the little things get to me. Loyalty is deeply important to me, and I always go above and beyond for the people who I trust. While I'm kind, I'm also strong - I won't let anyone take advantage of me or those I care about. I am always looking out for the people in my life, and I am fully committed to ensuring the safety and well being of the children. \n\nI look forward to the opportunity to create a safe and trustworthy environment for your family.",

Cameron treated him as if he were one of her own, seamlessly integrating him into the Montessori care she provides for her own son.\n\nCameron consistently communicated with us, sending frequent pictures and updates, and was always mindful of asking questions to ensure she was aligned with our family's values and ideals for care. Her warm-hearted and loving nature made us feel safe and secure, knowing our son was in such capable hands.\n\nWe wholeheartedly recommend Cameron to anyone seeking a compassionate and dedicated caretaker.",

I have my own car, so bringing your loved one around would not be an issue. I am willing to help with meal prep and do light cleaning while watching the child(ren). Tutoring and assistance with homework is also not an issue for me as I have earned my Bachelor's and Juris Doctor degrees from Rutgers University. You may contact me if you have any questions.",
