I'm very responsible, independent, caregiving and more. My goal is to become a nurse, I graduated from UCC last year with associates science degree and my next step is to go to nursing school. I use to work for a single mom her daughter and I was with her after her surgery before I knew she needed a liver transplant, my duties were to make sure she takes her medicine every day morning and night. I had to make sure she was fed and had to take her baths. Overall they were so good to me and I was to them. I have references I could provide as well. I'm looking forward to doing interviews about my year's of experiences thank you!",

I am also a mother of 2 adult boys. Aside from my personal experience, I've worked as a preschool teacher since 1998. Over these years, I believe that each and every child I've taught has been a blessing to me. Children are so precious, so gifted, and so special in their unique personalities. It has been my lifelong objective to teach children love, kindness, respect, curiousity for learning and an enthusiasm for everything beautiful their lives have to offer.",

A little about me I am 25 years old, energetic, out going and reliable. I have over 10+ years of experience in child care with caring for multiple children from early age of infants up to 13 years old. I've had a nurturing and bubbly spark to me for kids every since high school working at summer camps. Soon after I graduate, I ended up working with a few families from the camp that I built relationship with. I am currently looking for early morning to early afternoon hours I look forward to hearing from you soon!",
