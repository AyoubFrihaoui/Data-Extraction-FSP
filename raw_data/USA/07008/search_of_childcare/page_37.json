I've worked with kids of all ages K-12 and Freshman-Sophomores in college. All experiences rewarding and at times challenging. But, I'm honored to have had a hand in their development.\n\nIn my spare time, I like to read, learn new languages, create pottery, journal, move my body (walking, yoga, dance), sing, cook, and spending time with my loved ones.\n\nOne thing you should know about me is that I am a family oriented person.

With a year of experience, I've gained the knowledge and skills to provide a safe, stimulating, and nurturing environment for children of all ages, from infants to preteens. I believe in fostering a child's natural curiosity and creativity while instilling a sense of responsibility and respect.\n\nI'm known for my patience, calmness, and friendly nature, which helps me connect with children and build trusting relationships. I keep parents informed about their child's day and any concerns that arise, using their preferred communication method.\n\nI'm comfortable enforcing household rules as guided by the parents, and I enjoy playing a variety of games with children, including outdoor sports, board games, and educational games that promote learning. Whether it's teaching them how to swim or helping them with their homework, I strive to make a positive impact on their lives.",
