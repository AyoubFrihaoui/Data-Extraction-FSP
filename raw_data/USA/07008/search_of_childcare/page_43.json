I've been providing childcare to tons of loving families for the past 4 years, through my job (gymnastic coach & daycare/summer camp counselor) as well as babysitting! I also am a full time college student majoring in pediatric psychology! I am CPR & first aid certified. I love helping families and making a positive impact on children's lives. I'm patient and calm with a creative and imaginative nature, I'm also very comfortable with enforcing household rules. I have experience caring for children of all ages from infants to teens! as well as caring for up to four children at a time. I enjoy playing sports, board games, puzzles, and educational games with children. I'm extremely comfortable communicating with parents about their child's day and any issues that arise, and I follow their preferred communication method. I firmly believe that open and honest communication is key to building trust with families.",
