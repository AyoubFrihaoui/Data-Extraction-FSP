Daily written reports, verbal communication at pickup, and regular text or phone call updates are my preferred methods.\n\nI'm very comfortable enforcing household rules and enjoy playing a variety of games with children, including outdoor sports, board games, and educational games. I'm comfortable caring for up to two children, ranging from infants to pre-teens. Although I have some college education, my skills and experience speak for themselves, and I've completed CPR training.\n\nOn a personal note, I don't have a car but I have reliable transportation , am comfortable with pets, and am more than willing to help with cooking and light housekeeping.",

I'm a non smoker and I have no issues with transportation. I can assist with Light Housekeeping and Cooking/Meal Preparation.
