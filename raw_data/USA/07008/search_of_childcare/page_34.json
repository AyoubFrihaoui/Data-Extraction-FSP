                    "experienceSummary": "As a dedicated childcare provider with over 5 years of experience, I am passionate about nurturing children's growth and development. My journey began with fulfilling babysitting roles, where I discovered the joy of positively impacting children's lives. My formal education includes a graduate degree, and I have completed coursework in early child development.\n\nI take pride in being patient and calm, creating a serene environment for children. I believe effective communication is key, so I provide regular updates to parents, either through written daily reports or via text or phone call, depending on their preferred method.\n\nI am comfortable caring for up to three children of various ages, from infants to preteens. I believe in respecting household rules set by parents and adapt my approach accordingly. My favorite games to play with children include outdoor sports, educational games, and classic board games.",
