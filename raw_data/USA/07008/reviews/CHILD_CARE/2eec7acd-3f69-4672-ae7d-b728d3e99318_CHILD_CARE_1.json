I cannot recommend Mariana enough- she is patient, nurturing, and kind. She is an excellent communicator and works with the parents on ensuring we are all aligned on our approach for behavior, development, etc. Mariana is extremely proactive, often seeking out and recommending classes and activities. She prioritized socializing my younger son, creating a group of friends that he sees every day which was very important to us. I fully trust Mariana with both children's safety and know that she diligently watches them when they are out. Both of my children love Mariana and I could not recommend her more- we would have kept her with our family indefinitely if she was not moving!",

I could not ask for a more caring and fun caretaker for a child, as well as a friendly, communicative and flexible employee for our household. Mari prepares healthy meals, partners with us on transitions like potty training and keeps us updated every day with pictures and news about our daughter’s day including any concerns she thinks we should be aware of like a sniffle or hard time napping. She proactively researches new games and activities for our daughter, finding great free events around town to give her new experiences and always gives 100% of her energy and joy to our family. She works with us on our schedule when I have to travel for work or we need her to come earlier or stay later. I would recommend her to any family - I only wish she could come with us as we’re moving away for a new job.  We are so lucky that Mari is a part of our daughter’s life.",
