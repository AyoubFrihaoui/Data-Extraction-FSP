            "displayText": "My only regret when I hired Liana was that I wish we had found her earlier. Everything with her was so easy. When it comes to childcare, there's so much stress, so it's nice when the person you hire doesn't add to that stress. One time I had her come watch my 2 boys while I tidied the house and ran some errands. I didn't have to explain or prompt her with what to do, like I have had to with other babysitters. She took charge, played with the boys, and they had the best time. We have recently moved. For awhile, we were back & forth between 2 states. We kept our dog in SI for a few weeks, and she was super helpful watching the dog, feeding, walking, etc. I really wish we had found her sooner. She always had a smile, there was never any drama, and the boys loved her. I should also mention that I have a 3 and 5 year old: 2 boys who are very rambunctious. The 5 year old has epilepsy. This is something that was a deterrent to many applicants. I told Liana about his epilepsy, medication, seizures, and what to do, during the interview. She felt confident that she could handle it. In addition, there were days she had to watch the boys from 5:30am-9 or 10pm, and she did so with no issues. I would hire her again in a heartbeat.",
