She can dive right in without having to be told what to do, but asks really good questions on important topics when she needs parental input.  Organized and professional with references and CPR certification. Overall, a very kind and nurturing caregiver.  Any family she works with would be extremely lucky to have her.",

We knew we could count on Victoria and her go with the flow attitude and flexibly was much appreciated. She is very kind and patient but also always made sure the kids were safe and following directions. We felt comfortable with Victoria driving them to activities and taking them to the park because we always knew the kids were in good hands.
