She is great with kids, and mine really loved spending the day with her. She communicated well with both me and them, and she found ways to keep them happy and busy. When my toddler son was feeling anxious about separating from me, Allyson was able to calm him down, which is not an easy feat. I really appreciated her being really attentive and responsible with the kids.",
