She is extremely trustworthy and patient with our boys. She keeps them active, playing outside and going for walks. She comes up with fun art projects for them. She has taught them so many things, writing, numbers, letters, etc. She makes it easy not to be worried that my kids are properly cared for. She has become part of our family. Happy to answer any questions.",
