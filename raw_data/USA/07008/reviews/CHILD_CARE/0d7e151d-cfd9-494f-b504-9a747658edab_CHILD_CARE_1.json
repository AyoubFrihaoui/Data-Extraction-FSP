She takes them on outings and play dates and she also has watched them overnight while we traveled. We have never had any issues. Fernanda is great at problem solving and handling all of the crazy kid stuff and our kids absolutely love her. She teaches them new things, creates games to play, and always tries to engage them with new activities. She has always cared for our household needs too (dishes, clean up, etc.) and never complains. Fernanda is a calm, patient, and fun person and she will be an asset to any family who hires her. We are so sad to say goodbye to her!!",
