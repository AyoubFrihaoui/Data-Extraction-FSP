My son who is shy fell in love with her instantly. Jaslin put my worries at ease and made me feel comfortable with using her as a caregiver. \r\nSo it is much pleasure that I'm able to recommend Jaslin as a babysitter/care giver. She has watched my son Mon-Friday every morning before she would drop him at the bus stop. She consistently arrived at our home on time, ready to attend to my son with a smile.",
