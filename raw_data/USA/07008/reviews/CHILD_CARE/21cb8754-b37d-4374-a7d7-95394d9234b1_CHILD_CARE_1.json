She cared for our 15 month old daughter who had only ever been cared for by family. Moshira was extremely patient with my daughter who had pretty significant stranger anxiety and as a result, my daughter warmed up to her in no time. Moshira developed such a beautiful relationship with my daughter and we were so lucky to have her as part of our family. She is also a fabulous cook, and she cooked healthy meals for me and my daughter! Highly, highly recommend. ",

When they were babies she kept them on my schedule, made their food, cleaned bottles etc.  As they've grown, she safely drives them to all of their after school activities  She's a careful driver which I appreciate.  She puts away their laundry and keeps their rooms tidy.  She loves my kids like her own.  She is a fantastic cook and my kids love her food.  She has become a part of our family, but our kids are now all in full time school and we are working from home these days, so our needs have changed.  Anyone would be extremely lucky to have Moshira grow with their family!  Please reach out if you have any questions thanks.",
