My daughter is always excited to see her and runs to her for a big hug when she arrives. Aracely is very professional and stays in touch with me via text to let me know that my daughter is doing well and updates me on their activities throughout the day. She is a fantastic babysitter; is responsible, caring, honest, communicative and on-time throughout her employment with me. Overall, Aracely is so genuine and a true natural with children and I recommend her wholeheartedly.",
