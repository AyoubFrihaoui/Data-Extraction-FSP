I can trust her with my kids as though we are family! She not only shows my kids so much love, she is patient, understanding, fun, and adventurous. The kids absolutely love her and ask for her all the time!! I am so grateful to have her in my life, going out is so much easier with her just a phone call away to watch the kids if need be. I have nothing negative to say about her, overall everything about her is pure, genuine and unique. I wish there were more people like her. Thank you again!!",
