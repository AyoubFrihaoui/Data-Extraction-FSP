She watched my kids twice a week over the summer and it was a joy to have her. \r\nAmanda always came to our home on time, cheerful and ready to engage with the children. She is intelligent, kind and a great listener. My kids love Amanda, and would always look forward to spending time with her. That said, she always followed our directions in regards to the children (bedtimes, food, etc.) and they respect her as an authority figure. We still engage her services about two evenings per month. \r\nBy hiring Amanda, you can be assured that you won't get a teenager who lounges around watching TV while your kids fend for themselves. Amanda is fun and hardworking, any family that hires her has very fortunate children.\r\n",
