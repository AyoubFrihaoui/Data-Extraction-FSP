I was always impressed by her ability to connect with her, encouraging her curiosity and creativity.\nBeyond her professional skills, she is reliable and punctual. I never had to worry when my daughter was in her care. I highly recommend Jully to any family seeking a dedicated and loving caregiver. \n\nAshley R. ",

Everything seemed great with Jenifer aka \"Jully\" she was responsive to my job listing, we chatted on the phone-seemed nice as well as exchanged text messages. I invited her for a interview, after going over all of the details she seemed interested in the position and a good fit for my family. After the interview, she accepted the position and was going to give me references from the current family she is worked with. \"Jully\" did not provide me with any references and did not respond  to my email, text messages or phone calls regarding the references or to let me know if she was still interested in the position. She is highly unprofessional and obviously not reliable! Jully was invited to my home, was around my children and then just ghosted me. If she had a change of heart, she should have had the decency to just say so. Jully should not be trusted around your children, you have been warned!",
