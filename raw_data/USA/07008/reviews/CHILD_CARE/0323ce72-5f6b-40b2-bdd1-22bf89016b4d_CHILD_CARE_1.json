She is a great resource to bounce ideas off of as well, whether it’s deciding the next toy to buy, what material of clothes to purchase, what creative meals to feed, etc. She pays such close attention to our son and always catches things that may cause concern and brings them to our attention. On top of that, she’ll help us solve the problem, if any. She makes each day fun, educational, full of life, and productive. She works on developmental milestones for our son and also does activities that he enjoys. She is a good and honest person, and sticks to her word. She makes my life easier by ensuring all baby-related chores are completed in a timely manner. She is truly the best (I wish there was a stronger word to convey this!) and I would never hesitate to refer her. ",
