It was not easy for me to find someone I could say that about.  Donna is an experienced mother and has young grandchildren, so she knows what she is doing!  She is comfortable caring for children when they are sick, and is capable of making day to day decisions that are in their best interest.  My children love Donna, and are very comfortable with her and therefore so are we!  Donna is also VERY punctual.  Happy to discuss further by email or phone.",
