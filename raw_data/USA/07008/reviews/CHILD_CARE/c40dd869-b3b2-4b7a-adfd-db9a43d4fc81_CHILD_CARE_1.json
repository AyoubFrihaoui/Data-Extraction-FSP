She  expressed that the money I was offering was low but she would accept. I drafted a contract, invited her to my home. She met my two boys and stayed for an hour only to tell me the next morning she would not be accepting the position. However, she offered to help me for a week. Which makes me believe her new position must be starting on the 15th. I would have preferred her to decline my offer and not have visited my home during a pandemic if she was still considering higher offers.  Very disappointing.",
