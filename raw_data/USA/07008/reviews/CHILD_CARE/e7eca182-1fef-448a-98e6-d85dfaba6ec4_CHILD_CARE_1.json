            "originalText": "Erinma is an outstanding babysitter! She recently watched my two boys, and I couldn't be happier with the care she provided. Erinma is not only incredibly responsible and patient, but as a children's book author, she brought a creative and engaging energy to the time she spent with my kids. They were captivated by her stories and activities, and it was clear that they felt safe and comfortable with her. Erinma’s warm and nurturing nature made the entire experience enjoyable for my boys, and they can’t wait to have her back. I highly recommend her to anyone looking for a top-notch babysitter!",
