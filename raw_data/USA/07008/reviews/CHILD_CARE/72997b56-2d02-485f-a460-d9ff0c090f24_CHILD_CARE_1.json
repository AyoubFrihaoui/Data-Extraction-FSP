We had an urgent post for care on the weekend & she was available within hours! \r\nPunctual and dependable are not great enough of a description for her saving the day! She brought her own toys and activities which is a plus when the 1,000 toys already at home are boring my children! She handled the chaos with ease, even as our big dog made sure several times to walk through a puzzle that my 7 year old(with learning delays) was still able to focus and complete! She passed the dogs security checks and she juggled ALL FIVE of them with expertise. Thank you Shqiponja! Your positive can-do personality is uplifting and the children can't wait for their next fun play date with you! BONUS: She helped organize the playroom toys and furniture with great ideas for fun and efficiency for exploratory play for the little ones which I need as a single working mother (every Lego & marble!)",
            "originalText": "My four children ages 2-11 have decided Shqiponja is currently their favorite sitter from the first hour of meeting! We had an urgent post for care on the weekend & she was available within hours! \r\nPunctual and dependable are not great enough of a description for her saving the day! She brought her own toys and activities which is a plus when the 1,000 toys already at home are boring my children! She handled the chaos with ease, even as our big dog made sure several times to walk through a puzzle that my 7 year old(with learning delays) was still able to focus and complete! She passed the dogs security checks and she juggled ALL FIVE of them with expertise. Thank you Shqiponja!
