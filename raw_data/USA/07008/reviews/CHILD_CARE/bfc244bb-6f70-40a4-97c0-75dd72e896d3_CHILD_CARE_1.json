            "originalText": "Our family hired Dana in 2014 to help with our mom who was 90 years old at the time and living home in \nBerkeley Heights.  Our mom is now 100 years old and although she resides in a nursing facility, Dana visits mom at least 3 days per week for a couple of hours and provides her with loving companionship and care. Mom is clearly more frail and her cognitive status has declined with age but I truly feel mom would not be with us if not for Dana's regular visits and loving support.  Knowing Dana is there to check on mom's care on a regular basis has provided our family with the comfort of Knowing mom is comfortable and safe.  The nursing facility care is wonderful but Knowing Dana has eyes on mom when we cannot get there but once per week provides us comfort. Her knowledge, expertise and extreme compassion is exceptional.  We have been truly blessed to have Dana help us to care for mom for almost 10 years! Any family would be privileged to have Dana caring for a  family member.  She is professional, reliable and goes above and beyond. Mom considers her as one of her children and we all agree she is family.  ",

She has taken care of my 11 & 13 year old boys after school from 3:00 to 6:00 several days a week, for about eight months.  She provides them with a snack, helps them with their homework and drives them to various sport activities.  She has also given them with dinner on nights that I have needed her to stay after 6:00pm.  I have a 12 year old chocolate lab that she feeds and walks once a day.  Dana has a wonderful relationship with both my sons and I trust her very much.  She is a kind, caring, reliable and professional person.  She goes above and beyond without me even asking.  I would recommend her to anyone for taking care of their children.",
