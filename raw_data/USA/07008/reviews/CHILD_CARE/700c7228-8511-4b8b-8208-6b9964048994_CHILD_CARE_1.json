            "displayText": "Sara worked as a nanny for my 10-year-old son for the first part of 2012. I highly recommend her for future employment. She is not only dependable and trustworthy, she is kind and fun too. My son enjoyed playing board games with her, as well as going to the park or to the movies with her. He is on the spectrum and Sara was always patient with him while helping him with his homework. She went above and beyond her duties as a nanny. She'd have him do activities aimed at improving his speech/conversational skills and social skills.\r\n\r\nI've always felt it was safe to leave my son with her. She was very understanding of my irregular work schedule. She even transported my son to a doctor's appointment when I couldn't make it home on time.\r\n\r\nI feel very lucky to have found her. We're moving to Chicago and we wish we could have taken her with us.",
