I can trust her to keep the kids in check and follow rules I put in place as well as keep my house guidelines in check while we are out.  She also plays with them, reads books to them and makes them feels safe and comfortable. Our kids are safe, clean and happy - and that's what matters the most.",

            "displayText": "Yolanda was with my family since my twins were 1 month old til about 7 years old. She is extremely caring, kind, and reliable.   \r\n\r\nShe is very good with infants, toddlers, and older children.  I should add she was calm and capable dealing with my preemie twins who came home on apnea monitors their first month.  She also is very comfortable with dogs (my poodles adore taking walks with her).  \r\n\r\nShe has helped the girls with homework, arranged wonderful outdoor activities for them, has taken them to all their after-school activities, and is readily available to work longer hours including weekends as needed.  \r\n\r\nI travel 25% and have never had a problem getting her to cover my odd schedule when I travel (including almost 7 years of international travel with trips that could last a week).  She never just sits and watches TV ---- she wants the girls to be active and out and about (including to the township pool in the summer).  \r\n\r\nShe also teaches them how to be polite and responsible (a nice mirroring of our own teaching).\r\n\r\nShe has made my family  work  and I never felt a single twinge of fear when she was with my kids. I even kept her employed with us for a year after my husband lost his job because she was so vital to the functioning of my house (we let her go after his unemployment lasted for more than a year).\r\n\r\nShe has a driver s license.  She speaks wonderful English but also is open to speaking Spanish (at my request she has spoken Spanish to my daughters since they were infants and now they are fluent in Spanish).  \r\n\r\nShe also cooks for my kids, changes their sheets, does their laundry, and helps them pick up after themselves.  She also has been a lifesaver by doing errands for me (cleaners, grocery, getting the car serviced, etc).",
