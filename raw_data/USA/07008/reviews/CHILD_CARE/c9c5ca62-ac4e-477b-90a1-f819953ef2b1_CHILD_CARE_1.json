            "displayText": "Melanie is amazing!! We hired her to watch our 4 month old baby when I went back to work. We also had a toddler (2 1/2) in school part time so she would watch both kids in the afternoon. She came up with all sorts of games to entertain our toddler and was an absolute dream watching our kids. To this day, she comes over to say hi to them, brings them Christmas presents and asks about them regularly. Even though Melanie is no longer our FT nanny, she still comes over for date nights and whenever we need an extra pair of hands. She is trustworthy and kind, super punctual and reliable. We were lucky to have her and would recommend her in a heartbeat.",
