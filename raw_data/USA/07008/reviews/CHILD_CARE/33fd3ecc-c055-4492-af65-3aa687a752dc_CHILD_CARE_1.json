She quickly became a part of our family, providing a warm and nurturing environment that made both kids feel safe and happy.\n\nEugenia was incredibly attentive to our baby’s needs, ensuring a consistent routine with feeding, naps, and playtime. She was equally wonderful with our 5 year-old, engaging them in creative activities, school readiness exercises, and outdoor play. Her patience, kindness, and ability to balance the needs of both children were truly remarkable.\n\nUnfortunately, we had to let Eugenia go due to our relocation, but we wholeheartedly recommend her to any family in need of a caring and dedicated nanny. She is truly one of a kind, and we are grateful for the love and care she provided our children.",
