She became part of our family and watched him all day, Monday through Friday while we worked.  When she started my son was just a baby and she fed him bottles (pumped breast milk and then formula), progressed to solids, and eventually Joanna started cooking for him (chicken soup which she pureed and my son LOVED).  She took him for daily walks in the stroller and drove to the zoo for outings.  She took good care of him and loved him as if he was her own.  As he got older she took him to pre-K and various sporting practices.  She was always on time and reliable. She was flexible with her schedule and was available if we needed her to come earlier or stay later.    She also did light housekeeping for us.  She is great and I would highly recommend her to care for your child.",
