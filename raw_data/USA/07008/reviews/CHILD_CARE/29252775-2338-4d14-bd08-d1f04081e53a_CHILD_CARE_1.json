Although, as a young girl and related to me, she did not let it prevent her from doing a good job for me.  She was thorough, dedicated, willing to learn and precise in her work.  She showed me that she would grow up to have good work ethics.  As a grown up she has tackled certain endeavors and with hard work and determination has always accomplished what she set out to do.  She is a hard worker, honest, dependable, patient, compassionate and has a good heart. She does not allow outside influences interfere with what she has to do. If we still had our business and had not sold it, I would certainly love to give her a permanent position.  All young girls should be like her. Good employees are hard to find these days and anyone who employs her will not be sorry.",
