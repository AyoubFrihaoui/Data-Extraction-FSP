However, I do not regret taking that step. Khay has been great with the kids. She mainly watches our youngest who is nine months old, but has assisted with the older children as well. I love that she handles the baby with care. She reads to him and has introduced educational toys and overall is very patient. She even washed the baby bottles. ☺️ If you’re looking for a sitter, she’s an awesome choice.. I just hope it doesn’t interfere with my needs lol. ",
