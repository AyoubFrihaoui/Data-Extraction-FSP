She had a genuine interest in providing care in the manner that the parents want/what's best for the child- I could tell she was putting in her best effort. Also, she had patience and adapted quite well to our little one's inconsistent schedule and fussiness, trying all manner of things to keep him content. She graciously did a number of other tasks during nap times as well. Erin was punctual, friendly, and has a positive attitude. She will excel with caring for children of toddler age through school age.",
