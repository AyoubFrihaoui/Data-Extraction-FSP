She is just such a loving and caring person. Warm  and kind individual and is always punctual. I always appreciated the fact that she always keeps me updated - via text - with my daughter while I’m away. It’s nice to know what’s going on. She always makes me feel at ease, and ALWAYS has activities for my daughter to do  which is a plus. This is why I ALWAYS call Maya. She is extremely reliable and helpful!",

This is terrible considering how well she was treated. She gave her proper notice and we agreed that she would work on a few Sunday's to transition. She never did that. She texted me the night before that she would not come back. We never even told my son she was leaving since it wasn't her final day. He is still asking for Maya which is so difficult to watch. He does not understand why he can't see her anymore. This is not the way to end any job especially with a child with special needs. It's obvious she never intended to stay on any longer. I just wish she was honest for the sake of my son who remains the victim in all of this.  Very sad way to treat a special needs child.",

She is kind, but firm which is an important combination for any caregiver. She was always punctual, and did a better job of sticking with the daily schedule than I do! We have recently moved out of state. When I hired her, we were looking for a house and I wasn't sure if we'd still be in SI for 1 or 2 months. She was completely understanding, and happy to help as much as she could. She is an amazing cook (I do not cook) which we all enjoyed. She is professional and mature beyond her years which I think you will be aware of, the moment you meet her. She was great with our dog as well. I had had a very difficult time finding a babysitter willing to watch my boys. I worked 12 hour shifts as a RN in Manhattan. Maya arrived at 5:30am and was there until 9:30 or 10:30pm most days, with no complaints. Most of all, my 5 year old has epilepsy. This scared away many applicants-applicants older than Maya. In the interview, I explained about his medication, what to look for, and what to do if he had a seizure. She felt confident that she could handle it. I wish we could take her with us! If you hire Maya, you have not only hired a babysitter, but an asset to you're entire family. ",
