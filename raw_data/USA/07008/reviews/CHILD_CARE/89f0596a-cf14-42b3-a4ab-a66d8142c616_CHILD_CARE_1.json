Maria picked S up from daycare, prepared meals, bathed her, and put her to bed before we arrived home late in the evenings. She was an extended member of the family and very kind, patient with children, and trustworthy. She is also great at anticipating needs and would perform light house hold chores (S's laundry, etc) on a regular basis. Maria would still be with us today if we hadn't decided to go with a live-in Au Pair due to the pandemic, and she was immensely helpful during her time with us and provided peace of mind. We would certainly work with Maria again should conditions become more favorable for our family.",
