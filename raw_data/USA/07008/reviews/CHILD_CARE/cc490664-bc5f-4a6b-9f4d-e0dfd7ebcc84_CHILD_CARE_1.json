She was energetic, upbeat, careful, engaging, and just so kind and warm with the kids.  They absolutely loved her and my daughter is VERY shy - she warmed right up to Mary and had a blast with her every day. They did everything from playing inside, riding bikes, playing in the pool, chatting, doing arts and crafts, etc. Mary is incredibly reliable and responsible.  I trust her immensely and wish she could be our childcare all the time! :) ",
