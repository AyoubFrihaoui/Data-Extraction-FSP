She guided our daughter through learning and enrichment activities on a daily basis, taking on different \"lessons\" as she begins to hit her various milestones. Inside the home they work on learning new words, developing creative skills, caring for her dolls and much more. Outside the home Erika takes her to the park to explore, the library, music class and the play gym to just name a few.
