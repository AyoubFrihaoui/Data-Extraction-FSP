I wouldn't hesitate to hire her on the spot. My father wasn't always in a great mood but she seemed to change that really quickly she always knew how to get a laugh out of him. She's very quirky and silly but very professional when it comes to her job.  She always made sure he knew he wasn't alone.She would even come over to see him on her off days. We truly appreciate and are thankful that people like her exist .",
