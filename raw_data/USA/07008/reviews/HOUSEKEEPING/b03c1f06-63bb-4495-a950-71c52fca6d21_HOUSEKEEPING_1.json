She helps us in the morning getting the kids to school - unloading the dishwasher, packing lunches, getting the kids out the door, handling their school drop offs and then returning for light household work, i.e. childrenâ€™s laundry, straightening their rooms, etc. She is warm, caring and always engaged with the kids. I would recommend her without hesitation!",

A brief list: Errands including grocery shopping shopping, dry cleaners, laundry, light housekeeping, dinner prep, some cooking, animal feeding/care, accepted deliveries and take packages/mail to the appropriate shipper and so much more. She often anticipated needs before I even realized I needed help. Lorraine helped me be a better mother to by sons. I was able to be less stressed and overwhelmed by all that is expected of us as working moms. I truly wish I had thought to get someone to help earlier in my life journey. Having someone I could depend on really did wonders for me and my family. Moving out of state stopped our business relationship but in turn I gained a friend. I highly recommend Lorraine.",

She will be there when you ask to her to be there, no excuses.\n*Responsible - Hand her a list (or just verbally communicate what you need) and she will get everything done to a high standard with minimal to zero supervision.\n*Takes initiative - She anticipates your needs and springs into action before you ask her to.\n*Loving - she is incredible with the kids! Has the energy to keep up and productively engage with my vivacious daughter, whether it is taking her outside to play, or keeping her busy indoors with crafts and board games.\n*Sincere - it's hard to come by people who genuinely care about what they do, but Lorraine is among the few who gives her all to her job. She has a good heart and a kind soul.\n\nYou would be crazy not to hire her!",
