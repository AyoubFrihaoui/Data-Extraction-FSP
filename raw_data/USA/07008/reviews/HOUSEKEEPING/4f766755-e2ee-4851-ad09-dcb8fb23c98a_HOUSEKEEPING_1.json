She has been cleaning our house for years and is hands down the most detailed and attentive person who has worked with us.  We are rarely home when she cleans but when we are, we can see the hard work that she does.  And when we aren't home, we come home to a spotless home, notes about things she noticed and over the course of the following week we get nice surprises when we see the little details that she cared for when she was at our house (inside of fridge, windows, even the garage!)  She does it all and anyone would be lucky to have her in their home.",
