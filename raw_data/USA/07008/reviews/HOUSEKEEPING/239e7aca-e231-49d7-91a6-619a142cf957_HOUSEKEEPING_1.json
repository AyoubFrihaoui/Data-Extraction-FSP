Diane proved to be exactly what I saw in her other 5 star reviews: very responsible, punctual, helpful.  She took the house keeping load off of my Husband, doing all housekeeping and cooking tasks.  She made a wonderful roast chicken meal for us, muffins too!  She did laundry, cleaned our house, helped me in everything I needed help with (including meals and making sure I was safe and had not fallen).  She made fast work of being friends with our cat - who is an older grumpy lady who was purring and happy immediately with Diane!  She is very independent and handy as well - we hope to hire her again for house projects in the future! My Husband and I can recommend her for care for the injured, for housekeeping/house cleaning, cooking and pet care without reservation! ",
