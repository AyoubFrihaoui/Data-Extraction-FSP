I let go of my previous cleaners in hopes of hiring someone that could grow with my family. In the few days before Ruth was supposed to start, she stopped returning my calls or texts and then blocked me on Care.com so that I couldn't reach out. She did not even have the decency to tell me that she didn't think it would work out. If I could give her zero stars, I would. In the end, it's a blessing as i would  never want someone like Ruth coming into my family home and becoming a part of my family. There are many other more professional, reliable and decent  people out there.",
