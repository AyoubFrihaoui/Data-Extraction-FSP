As I've been struggling to keep things tidy being pregnant and welcoming a new baby, Lucy has always been friendly and warm.  She does a great job cleaning places I didn't even think to look and will buy the supplies for me so I don't have to go out.  She also takes the rags home to wash instead of leaving them for me!  Definitely recommend her for cleaning services! ",
