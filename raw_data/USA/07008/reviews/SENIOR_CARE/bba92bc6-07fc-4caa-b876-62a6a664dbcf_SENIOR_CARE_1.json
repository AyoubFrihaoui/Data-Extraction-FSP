When my husband and I interviewed Adrian, there was such an immediate connection.  She was professional but most importantly she connected with my dad.  She has a natural ability to engage with and understand my dad's felt needs.  What I love about the service she provides is her interest in getting to know my dad, not just from a caregiver-to-patient relationship, but her interests lie in something far greater which is understanding my dad as a person and not a client.  When she understood that my dad loves gospel songs or likes to eat ice cream or his love for his deceased wife, she was able to tap into that part of him that brings joy by engaging in his areas of interest.",
