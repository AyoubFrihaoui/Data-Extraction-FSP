As a friend, I’ve seen firsthand how dedicated, kind, and compassionate she is in everything she does. She has over 6 years of experience caring for seniors with Dementia, Parkinson’s, Cancer, Strokes, and mobility challenges, and she always goes the extra mile to make sure her clients feel comfortable and loved.\n\nJoanita isn’t just great at her job—she has a huge heart. She helps with everything from bathing, dressing, meal prep, and medication management to simply being a comforting presence. She’s also super trustworthy, reliable, and easy to talk to, which makes her clients feel safe and at ease. Plus, she has her own car, so she’s always there when needed, whether it’s for errands or doctor’s appointments.\n\nI’ve always admired how patient and hardworking she is. Taking care of others isn’t just a job for Joanita—it’s her passion. Anyone who has her as a caregiver is truly lucky!\n\nWould highly recommend her to anyone looking for a kind, professional, and loving home health aide!",
