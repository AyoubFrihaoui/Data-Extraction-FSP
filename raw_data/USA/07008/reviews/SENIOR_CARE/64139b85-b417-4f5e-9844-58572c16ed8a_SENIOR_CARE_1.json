But I decided to meet and talk with her to see her side and see how she is in person. I’m not sure who that other review met but it was not Shanice cause the person I met and eventually hired has been the direct opposite of what that person said. Shanice was nothing but professional, responsive, caring and compassionate. She has treated my mother maybe better than me I hate to say it. My mothers needs comes first she has never missed a day and it has never been difficult to get in touch with her. She’s brings a bright, energetic and caring work attitude every day. I would hire and recommend her to anyone. I’m glad I decided to meet with her instead of relying on reviews. ",

            "originalText": "Shanice initially appeared responsible, and her references were in order. She agreed to take on the caregiver role outlined in her Care skills post. She seemed reliable, professional, and trustworthy. \n\nAfter agreeing on the rate, \"something unforeseen happened,\" which prevented her from showing up. This notification came from a text message the night before, which was very last notice. Still, despite this obvious red flag of unreliability, I gave her the benefit of the doubt. She stated in the text message that she would show up the following week. She would not respond via telephone after the initial hiring, only text message, which was also odd. So, the next week came, and I called her the night before her second scheduled start date (which would have been her first since she failed to show up last week) with my parents to confirm if she was still coming. No return call. No text message. She did not show up again - a complete lack of professionalism and complete disregard of trust. I called her and left a voice message for her to let me know what happened, but there was no response. I called again hours later - no response. If she spent more time offering support as a caregiver than she does with changing her profile picture multiple times, she would be worthy of the role of caregiver to those in need. \n\nTo dismiss this job, or any other, without the courtesy of a call or explanation is terrible. To dismiss the expectation of showing up to help elderly clients, mine and others, is reprehensible. I would give negative starts if that were an option. If she did not want the job, she could have said so in the beginning instead of not showing up twice. She failed my parents and her role as a caregiver. This experience made me question the authenticity of the posted reviews and the \"references\" she provided. One of her references sounded like her sister, whom I spoke with on a different day regarding doing my mother's hair. This was much stranger than fiction. \n\nThis experience also made me question the safety of my parents and who was allowed into their home. Care must do a better job vetting their caregivers because this experience was enough for me not to continue on this platform. To all potential caregiver seekers, please see this review as a cautionary tale of what could happen to your loved ones (deception, misrepresentation, lack of safety) or worse. ",
