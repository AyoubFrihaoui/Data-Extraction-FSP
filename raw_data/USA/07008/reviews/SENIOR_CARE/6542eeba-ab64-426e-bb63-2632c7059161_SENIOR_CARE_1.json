The level of care, initiative, genuine concern, professionalism and love that Rondene shared with our family was unparalleled. Not only would  I hire her again for anyone in my family that needed help, but I recommend her 100%. The world is a better place bc women / people like Rondene make it that way. Anyone would be blessed to have her in their life. We certainly were. ❤️",
