Mom is now 96 and has gone through many changes but Dana has been with us all the way. She is a skilled professional and any family would be fortunate to hire her. Simply stated she is an Angel. Dana's assistance has been such a great help to our family. We actually consider her family! I am a registered nurse and would highly recommend Dana to any family looking for an individual that is caring, trustworthy, has the ability to recognize concerns or issues related to a loved one's health and emotional well being, whether the person is elderly or a child. Professional, dependable, caring are only a few of the fine words to describe Dana. We are blessed to have her taking care of our mom!",
