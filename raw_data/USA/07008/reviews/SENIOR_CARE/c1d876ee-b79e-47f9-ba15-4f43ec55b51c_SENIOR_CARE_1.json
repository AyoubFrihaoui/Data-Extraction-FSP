It was somewhat last minute, and through the grace of God, we found Lilla.  I knew from the moment we spoke, she was the perfect fit for my mom.  Well, she was all that and more!  Lilla's main responsibilities were bathing, dressing, feeding and getting mom ready for the day.  She was extremely reliable, patient, trustworthy and compassionate.  Mom has some slight cognitive issues and relies on a walker to get around.  Lilla spoke to her in a manner in which she felt comfortable and safe.  I would highly recommend Lilla to care for your loved one, and her skill set would not limit her to just the elderly.",
