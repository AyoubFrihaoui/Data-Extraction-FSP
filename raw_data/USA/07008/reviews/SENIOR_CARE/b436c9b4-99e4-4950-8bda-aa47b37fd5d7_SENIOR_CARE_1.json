She has so many years of experience so I felt confident and so comfortable having her take care of my favorite person, my nana. She puts her whole heart into every interaction, every meal, every single thing she does and it’s the most beautiful thing. My nana had such a great time with Ava and Nana improved and flourished in ways I didn’t think were possible. Ava focused so much on quality of care, dignity, respect, meaningfulness and fun. Ava has become part of our family because of the person she is and the care with my Nana. I could not recommend Ava enough to any and everyone I know looking for a professional companion. ",
