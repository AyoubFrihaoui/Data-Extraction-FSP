She cared for my mother for one year until she passed in 2020 and provided dedicated support to my father for four years until he passed in May 2024. Both of my parents had dementia and required assistance with daily living activities.\n\nBella’s caring nature and genuine compassion shone through in every interaction. She treated my parents with the utmost respect and kindness, always ensuring they felt comfortable and valued. Her patience was remarkable, especially given the challenges that come with dementia care. She remained calm and composed in every situation, no matter how difficult.\n\nOne of Bella’s standout qualities is her ability to adapt to any circumstance. She was always proactive, adjusting her approach to meet the evolving needs of my parents. Her flexibility and problem-solving skills were invaluable, providing our family with peace of mind.\n\nBella’s dedication and love for her work were evident, and she truly became a part of our family. Her presence brought comfort and joy to my parents’ lives, and I will forever be grateful for her care. If you are looking for a reliable, compassionate, and skilled caregiver, Bella is the best choice you could make.",
