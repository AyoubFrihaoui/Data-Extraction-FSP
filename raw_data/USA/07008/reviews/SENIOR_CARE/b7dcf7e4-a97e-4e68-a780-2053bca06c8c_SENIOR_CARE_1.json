She brightens spirits which is an intangible trait that helps with care, helps the people she's caring for and gives peace of mind to families knowing their loved one has someone that truly enjoys helping . She is also is a hard worker with a lot of energy, she sees a need, something that needs to be done and gets it done, including the littlest things. For example she would clean the filtering water pitcher thoroughly without having to ask!! Bigger and more important things she did for us like preparing delicious healthy food and making sure my bed-bound father was always clean and repositioned. Nino is thoughtful, friendly, trustworthy and hardworking. I highly recommend Nino as a caregiver.",
