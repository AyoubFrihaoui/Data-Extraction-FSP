I can not recommend her highly enough.  \n\nI knew right away when I spoke with her that she was responsible, reliable and empathetic.  What I didn't know was how willing she was to be flexible and always do what was in the best interests of my father.\n\nPamela kindly discovered my father's interests and worked hard to have conversations with him about those topics to keep his brain working and entertained.  She did a wonderful job taking care of his physical needs.  When he had to go to the hospital, rehab and eventually an assisted living facility, she went to each of those places and continued to do her job in a kind and professional manner.  \n\nAs her role veered more toward being a companion, Pamela was my eyes and ears at my father's assisted living facility.  She was always watching out, making sure he was being well cared for and was willing to speak up to those as the facility as needed.  She kept me abreast on a daily basis of what was happening there and how my father's was doing.  \n\nDo yourself a favor and hire Pamela for your loved one.  You won't be sorry.\n\n",
