All of these things would already distinguish her from most caregivers.  But, it is her sincerity, kindness, and patience that she shows to my mother that is most wonderful.  Kadia understands the importance of engaging my mother in conversation, giving her a reassuring pat on the arm, or holding her hand.  Kadia provides everything that is needed to give my mother the best quality of life.  My mother's eyes light up when she sees Kadia and she has a lovely connection with her.  I also deeply appreciate that Kadia is an excellent and courteous communicator with me.  On the rare occasion when she has had to change her schedule, she has told me far in advance.  And, if I'm out running errands, she stays in touch with me by text and phone to let me know how my mother is doing.  I feel very fortunate to have met Kadia, am very grateful for the care that she provides to my mother, and highly recommend her as a caregiver.  ",
