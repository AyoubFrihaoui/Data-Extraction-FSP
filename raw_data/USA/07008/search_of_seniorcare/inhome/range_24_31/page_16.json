I am currently in college and looking for a full or part time caregiver role in Union NJ, Manhattan NY, or the surrounding areas.\n\nMost of my experience is with special needs children ages 4-11, specifically children with autism, ADHD, and down's syndrome. \n\nAlthough I do not have as much experience with seniors, I have personal experience with senior medication management, transportation to doctors appointment, providing assistance with everyday tasks, and light cooking and cleaning. I can provide more information upon request.\n\nOutside of professional work, most of my time is spent in the gym, hiking, in museums, or in new restaurants. I also spent a year studying media arts with a focus on photography & cinema, so I am more than happy to provide enrichment time. I enjoy painting, pencil sketching, all types of crafting, sewing, and baking.\n\nHope to find a long-term family to work for",
