Knowing my mom was in such loving and capable hands brought me so much peace. Nino isn’t just a caregiver, she’s someone who truly cares, and I’ll always be deeply grateful to her.",

The reason why I became a caregiver was because of my mother she had become ill and needed home care so I decided to put my career on hold to help her during her time of illness. After she had passed I decided that helping others gave me a sense of fulfillment knowing that I was there for them as a companion and being there to help someone when I can. I have experience with early onset of Dementia and Alzheimer's. I assist patients with personal hygiene care, medication reminder, schedule doctor appointments, transportation to & from appointments. Errands/shopping. Prepare meals and recommend nutritional changes when needed. Light house cleaning, laundry, feeding, bathing/dressing. Staying physically active, walks, personal shopping. I will work with the person & family member to schedule out a daily planner that fits their loved ones comfort level.",
