My patient had serious respiratory and mobility problems and Anastasia was always able to anticipate the patient's condition and prevent problems from occurring.  She also was quick to react professionally when problems occurred. When this patient died I hired Anastasia to live in with my mother-in-law who had cognitive and mobility issues for several years.  She was kind and again very knowledgeable and professional.  My mother-in-law lived in a senior \ncitizen building and everyone loved her.  After my \nmother-in-law died many residents wanted her to work for them .  I kept her number and recommended her to anyone that need a caregiver. ",
