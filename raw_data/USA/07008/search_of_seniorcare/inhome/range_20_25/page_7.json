Art projects/art therapy and reading was one of the pastimes we would enjoy working on. It was definitely therapeutic and a lot of fun. We would cook together and do some gardening, and just talking about life! Some of the many things I would do is sleep next to her, bathe her, prep food/tea, help her with medications, massage her, do groceries, housekeeping, doctor appointments, translation, and tasks. \nI also have my in services certificate for seniors.
