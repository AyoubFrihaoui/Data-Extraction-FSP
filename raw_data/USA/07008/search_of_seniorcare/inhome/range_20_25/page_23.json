I can provide more information upon request.\n\nOutside of professional work, most of my time is spent in the gym, hiking, in museums, or in new restaurants. I also spent a year studying media arts with a focus on photography & cinema, so I am more than happy to provide enrichment time. I enjoy painting, pencil sketching, all types of crafting, sewing, and baking.\n\nHope to find a long-term family to work for",
