I have a great deal of empathy and relate to the wants and needs of those I care for. I am responsible and reliable. I strive to always go the extra mile to make sure the people I care for are truly nurtured and trust that I will be there for them each day. I believe it is important to provide companionship and friendship while also attending to the daily needs of the individuals in my care. I cook, do laundry and provide light housekeeping. I have a car and am willing to run errands , food shop and provide transportation to and from appointments and such.\r\nSeniors deserve respect and tolerance.
