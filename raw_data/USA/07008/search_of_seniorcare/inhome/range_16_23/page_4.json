I have always been close to her and was her best companion. We would go everywhere together, from her favorite stores to long walks and adventures. Art projects/art therapy and reading was one of the pastimes we would enjoy working on. It was definitely therapeutic and a lot of fun. We would cook together and do some gardening, and just talking about life! Some of the many things I would do is sleep next to her, bathe her, prep food/tea, help her with medications, massage her, do groceries, housekeeping, doctor appointments, translation, and tasks. \nI also have my in services certificate for seniors. Please feel free to ask me to show you it!",
