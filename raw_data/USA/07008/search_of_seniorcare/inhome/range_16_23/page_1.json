I had to assist with daily personal care, transportation, be a companion, and becoming their friend came naturally. \n\nI like to study medicine, spend quality time with my family, shop, and give charity. \n\nI'm dedicated to my work. I'm a responsible and respectful person who genuinely has a caring soul. \n\nMy skills include communication, patience, observation.",
