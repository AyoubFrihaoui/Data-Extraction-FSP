I helped my mom with paying bills and banking. I love spreadsheets and have been trusted as treasurer of PTAs, and agencies caring for others. I was a construction estimator and I can assist with home renovation decisions & waiting for deliveries. I have 2 sons who are in the autistic spectrum, one who is non verbal. I do not know sign language or how to read lips but am interested in learning, teaching, or helping in that capacity. My dad passed away 13 years ago after an 8 year battle with cancer and I was there to help him and my mom with his care and transportation. I myself, am a 10 year breast cancer survivor.
