After a year or so I decided to go back to school to receive my CNA certification. I wanted to be even more involved with the residents and their care. I became so close with all of them, I thought of them as my family. I even had a few of my patients attend my wedding. I have about 8 years' experience working in all different types of settings, skilled nursing facilities, home care, and hospital settings. After getting married and having my first child, I left the nursing home world and started my amazing career at Rutgers-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School doing clinical research in the Neurology Department. I also will be going back to school in the fall to finish my nursing degree I started a few years back.",
