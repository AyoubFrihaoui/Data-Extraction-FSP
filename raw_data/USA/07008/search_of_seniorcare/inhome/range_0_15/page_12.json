They are looking for a dog sitter, they have four german shepherd that needed to be bathe, brush their teeth, walk and grill their food everyday, they eat steaks, boneless chicken and liver steak. I put them in the courtyard during the day, until the dogs died of cancer. My boss is 78 now and I am the one helping him on everything, from paying the bills, doctors appointment, prepare his foods, helping him shower, laundry, pretty much everything. He is sick now and they might bring him in a long term facility and might not need me anymore. As of now I am still employed by them 5 days a week until they transfer him to a facility. I was with their family in the last 14 years & 10 months. I am a very loyal, devoted with high respect to my employer. I am willing to travel if needed.",
