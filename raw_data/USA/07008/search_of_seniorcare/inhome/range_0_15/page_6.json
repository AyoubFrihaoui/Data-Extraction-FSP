You will likely become a more patient person who feels a stronger sense of gratitude for your health and the health of your loved ones. Helping others is also an emotionally fulfilling occupation.\n\nI'm looking for a job that will strengthen me as a person overall.\n\nI started caring for seniors when I was between the ages of 19-20.\n\nIn my spare time, I like to listen to music , paint, go on outing , and hang with my kids \n\nOne thing you should know about me is I'm very trustworthy, punctual, and takes pride in my work.\n\nMy skills include being a problem solver, communicating efficiently, and having empathy.",
