My grandfather had a great impact on my life and in his last years he was on numerous medicines for his blood sugar diabetes etc. Although he was very independent I enjoyed spending my time with him cooking, cleaning, keeping him company and making sure he was well taken care of. I am passionate about it because I feel like everyone should have the care and love like they are family . I am hoping to find someone who treats me like their own family so I can do the same and I can be a care giver for them long term. :)",
