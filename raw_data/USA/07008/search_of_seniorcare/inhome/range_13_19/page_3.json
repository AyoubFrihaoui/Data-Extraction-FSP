I was a caregiver for my elderly grandmother for 4 years, oversaw the needs of my father for several years. In addition, helped provide caregiving and companionship for my father-in-law who had dementia and lived with my wife and I for 5 years. I am a compassionate, caring, reliable person who enjoys helping others, keeping them engaged and improving their quality of life. Can perform housekeeping duties like light cleaning, laundry and preparing light meals. I enjoy making a difference in people's lives. \n\nOne thing you should know about me is I'm kind and caring, low key. My skills include creating conversation; I engage seniors by playing cards, board games, listening to music, reading to them, taking walks, etc.",
