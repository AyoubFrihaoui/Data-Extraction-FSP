    "summary": "Growing up, my aunts, uncles and family friends considered me a caring and responsible person. Accordingly, I used to babysit their children during the summer holidays. Moreover, when I was 16, my little brother, who is now 7, was born. Shortly after his birth, my mum went back to work, my brother and I were the ones who looked gladly after him. I used to help prepare his meals, change his diapers and put him to sleep. Now, I mostly help him with home works and do activities with him. Last year I had a 6 months Au pair experience in Berlin where I took care of two little girls aged, respectively, 3 years and 10 months. During the summer, I was a nanny in Zurich and looked after two children of 3 and 4 years old. Even though they require a lot of patience and care, I wholeheartedly believe that children are the purest thing that is on earth and find really liking spending my free time with them, thus why I used to babysit as well and have 3 years of paid experience. The last year I was a nanny for a baby and 2 toddlers twins in the Netherlands. I used to be a Red Cross volunteer and therefore hold the first aid certificate and can provide you with 3 reference letters, feel free to contact me.",
