At only 26 years old, I've been tutoring/ teaching for over 7 years. In high school, I worked part-time at a tutoring program with elementary students. At 17, I privately tutored a sixth grader for a year. In college, I received ""A""s in several early childhood education courses and completed fieldwork in a Montessori Preschool (where I also worked part-time for a summer). Fast forward to today... I am working full-time as a Title 1 Academic Intervention Teacher for elementary-aged students. This summer marks my one year anniversary in that position!

I would love to take all of that experience, knowledge, and skill and use it to help your child succeed in school. I am an extremely child-centered teacher and am very sensitive to children who struggle with anxiety, focus, insecurity, and depression. Not only do I hope to help your child succeed in their academics, but to also support their overall sense of self.

Tutoring: I have extensive experience tutoring elementary and middle school students as a teacher's assistant and as part of my high school's tutoring program (New Roads School).
