My name is Khai, and I offer reliable, detailed, and trustworthy cleaning services for homes, apartments, and small businesses. With a strong background in caregiving and housekeeping, I understand the importance of a clean, organized, and comfortable space.

As the oldest of five siblings, I learned early on how to manage busy households and keep things running smoothly. I also have experience working in senior living, where I developed strong attention to detail, respect for people's spaces, and a commitment to cleanliness and care.

I offer regular cleanings, deep cleans, move-in/move-out services, and I'm happy to help with light organizing, laundry, and errands if needed. Whether you're a busy parent, a working professional, or just need an extra hand, I'm here to make your life easier.
