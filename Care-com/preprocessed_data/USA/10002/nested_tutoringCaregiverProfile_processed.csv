With years of experience in childcare and tutoring, I have met all different types of children, personalities, and learning styles. I believe what makes me a great tutor is that I truly enjoy being around children and helping them. Whether the child is excited about school but needs a little supervision, has trouble staying focus, or overall is struggling and discouraged, I have always been able to find a way to connect and help achieve academic improvement.

I'm Jahna, and I'm excited to offer my services in tutoring for English, Science, Math, Art, Drama, and Film. I'm currently a second-year student at NYU, double majoring in Filmmaking and Environmental Science.

About Me:

Tutoring: I have extensive experience tutoring elementary and middle school students as a teacher's assistant and as part of my high school's tutoring program (New Roads School). I've also helped guide and assemble middle school film projects, from acting help to filming to editing. I'm known for blending art and academics, making learning both effective and fun for kids.

 Experience: I've been babysitting since high school and absolutely love it! I enjoy craft projects, games, and anything related to stories. (I've read a lot of books growing up!)
