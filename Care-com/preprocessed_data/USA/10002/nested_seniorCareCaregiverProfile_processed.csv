I was a live-in nanny for an overnight nurse during high school (kids were 6 and 9) and I put myself through college by being a live-in nanny in CT for a family of three kids (ages 2, 5 and 6) for 14 months. For three summers, I did fill-in/temp nanny work in NYC from newborns to age 12 and then was a live-in nanny for a 10-month-old in NJ for a year. I moved to Denver and provided nanny services for 10-month-old twins and their 10-year-old brother. 

I am a responsible house sitter, savvy personal assistant, non-smoker who is incredible with a wide variety of people. I am very compassionate.

I try very hard not to judge people, and that said, I have a lot of friends who are gay. I would be just as comfortable working for a gay person, even someone HIV+ as I have volunteered with AIDS programs. 

I have a clean driving record (for 27 years) and valid license. I have a current passport and can pass any drug test at anytime. I enjoy running errands, doing laundry, reading, listening to all kinds of music and staying in touch with friends and family.

My name is Kate and I love listening to people's stories and engaging in life with them, while helping relieve family members used to caring for them.

I began caring for my 97-year-old grandfather with Alzheimers during the pandemic, as I grew upon constantly listening to his stories and having adventures with him. I have three years of experience caring for the elderly and those with Alzheimers/Dementia focusing on engaging activities to aid in neuroplasticty, keeping people happy, receiving family members, light housework, and some grooming needs. I particularly have experience with WWII veterans and former artists, and love discussing history, life, and teaching my clients new things in their later years. 

Above all, I try to bring a smile to people's faces, and make lives a little easier.",,[],32808396,[],"{'amount': '20', 'currencyCode': 'USD', '__typename': 'Money'}","{'amount': '50', 'currencyCode': 'USD', '__typename': 'Money'}",[],"[""alzheimersOrDementiaExperience"", ""comfortableWithPets"", ""doesNotSmoke""]","{'currencyCode': 'USD', 'amount': '20', '__typename': 'Money'}","{'currencyCode': 'USD', 'amount': '50', '__typename': 'Money'}",[],"[""respiteCare"", ""personalCare"", ""mealPreparation"", ""lightHousekeeping"", ""errands"", ""dementia"", ""bathing""]",3.0,,

Caring for the elderly is a way to give back all the love and wisdom they offer. Interacting with them enriches my life and teaches me to value every moment. Therefore, I dedicate myself with passion and commitment to this profession, always striving to create a safe, welcoming, and loving environment for those under my care.
