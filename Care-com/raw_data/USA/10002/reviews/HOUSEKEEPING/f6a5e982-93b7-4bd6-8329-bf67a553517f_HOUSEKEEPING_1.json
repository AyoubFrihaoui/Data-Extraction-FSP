She is very caring, has a calm and balanced manner with the kids, wise beyond her years and very mature.  She works super hard, is professional, reliable, always on time and has always done whatever she can to accommodate any extra hours, staying late when I was stuck.  I trust the care of my 2 children to her without thinking twice.  Having worked with a number of casual babysitters over the last 3-4 years I can't recommend Janeth highly enough, she is everything you could ever need in a caregiver.  She helps with kids meal prep, the kitchen is always spotless when she's finished, and she has the kids fed and ready for bed and calm and the place put back together by 6pm in a way I can never achieve trying to do myself..    We lost our full time Nanny of 3.5 years recently and Janeth saved us over the summer stepping in and taking it on.  She is also a joy to be around",
