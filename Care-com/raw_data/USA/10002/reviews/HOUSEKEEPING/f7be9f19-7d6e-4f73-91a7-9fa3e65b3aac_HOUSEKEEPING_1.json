She took care of my two young children for a few years - my daughter from the age of two and my son as a newborn and up - and my children adored her. She's very organized, was always two steps ahead and kept everything tidy. She's also just a nice, pleasant person to be around. If we could have kept her with our family, we would have. I highly recommend her - she is a gem. Siham is also fluent in French, which was a plus for us!",
