            "displayText": "We hired Liubov aka Mary since September when school started. My husband and I felt very fortunate to have her work with us. It was like 2 days before my kid's first day of school and she came through. She's a very amazing genuine, punctual and honest person. She's always on time. Mary is very good with my two kids, 3yrs old and my 15mons old. She feed them, take them out to the park and give them attention. They love her, she's like a second mother to them. We honestly only need her help with our kids but she's very helpful all around. When I'm scrambling with chores, she would help me without questions. She would initiative help me clean the dishes, fold our laundry, organize toys, vacuum the apartment and give them a bath. I usually don't want her to do so much since we mostly want her to look after our kids. She is truly the sweetest person to have around our kids. I don't think I ever want her to leave. I wish I can give her more than 5 stars. We cannot stop appreciating her!",
