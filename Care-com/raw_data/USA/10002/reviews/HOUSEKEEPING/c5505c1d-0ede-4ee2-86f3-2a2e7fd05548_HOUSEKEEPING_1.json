She plays with him nonstop and takes him out for walks along the waterfront. She has traveled with us to weddings and family functions and is never on her phone in front of the baby.

When my daughter was napping, Salwa would clean, do dishes, prepare meals. She is never idle. Though she doesn't advertise this way she is really a home helper. As my daughter grew, Salwa also took her to activities around town and was always paying attention to what she was into (puzzles, etc.) and coming up with activities that aided her development. She has many years of experience; she came highly recommended by another family and I know that whoever hires here will be happy that they welcomed her into their home and their lives. We love her!",
