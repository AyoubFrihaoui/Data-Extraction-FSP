Our girls love her to pieces and vice versa. They are so calm with her. She reads to them, sings to them, takes them all around our neighborhood, all the playgrounds and libraries. Never on her phone, never not paying attention. She is always fully devoted to them. She's taught them so much. \r\n\r\nMarisa also does their laundry and light cleanups around the house which has been invaluable to my life and sanity.\r\n\r\nShe has a car and is generally very prompt. Also she rarely calls out- she knows the working parent's plight.\r\n\r\nWe miss her every day and the girls light up whenever she comes to babysit for us on a weekend. \r\n\r\nSimply put, Maris",
