They adored her, she took care of them like if they were her own.  My wife and I work until late, so we had Luz cooked for them, take them to the park and even did some light laundry for them. Overall, Luz was very good in what she does. Our kids always ask for her. I really recommend having Luz has a nanny, you will not be disappointed.",
