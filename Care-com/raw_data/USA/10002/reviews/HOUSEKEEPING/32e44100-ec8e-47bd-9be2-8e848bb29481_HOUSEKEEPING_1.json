            "originalText": "Frances was our full time nanny for a little over a year. She cared for our daughter from about 5 months to 1.5 years old. We absolutely love her and so does my daughter. As a first time mom I was very nervous about returning to work but Frances helped make it an easier transition and put my worries to rest. She cared for our daughter like her own and I knew she was in loving hands. Frances kept her safe, helped build good eating habits and kept her active. She’s very engaged and playful and doesn’t ignore the children. In fact, if you’re out at the playground all the kids flock to Frances because she’s playing and being silly with them all. She has a great energy and you can tell she really loves kids. I always came home to a clean and tidy space, she helped organize the closets and toys, and generally was a huge help to us and felt more like family. She’s still a part of our lives and we’ll continue to hire her for weekend babysitting. I would recommend her in a heart beat! ",
