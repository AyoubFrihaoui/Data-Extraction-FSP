She also did light housekeeping and ran necessary errands, as needed.\r\n\r\nSujatha is an extremely caring, professional and an incredibly hard working nanny. She would prepare feed both the kids, change diapers of the younger one, later help with potty training as he grew out of diapers, read to my older one, play with them and keep both of them engaged constructively. She kept the house tidy and managed to do housekeeping and any necessary errands alongside being responsible for kids. She took both my kids out to the playground, library and classes as their needs grew over time. She was always extremely organized, knew how to manage time well and was always very punctual.",
