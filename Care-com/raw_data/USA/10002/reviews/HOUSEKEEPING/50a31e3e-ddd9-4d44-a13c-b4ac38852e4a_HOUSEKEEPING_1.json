In addition to being extremely polite and friendly, Maria Teresa takes special care with details, ensuring that the environment is impeccable. Another strong point of hers is her language skills, she is fluent in English, Portuguese and Spanish, which makes communicating with different clients much easier. Furthermore, her kindness towards animals and her affection for children make her an even more special person. I recommend Maria Teresa with complete confidence for any professional opportunity! \n\nSincerely,\nJuliana",
