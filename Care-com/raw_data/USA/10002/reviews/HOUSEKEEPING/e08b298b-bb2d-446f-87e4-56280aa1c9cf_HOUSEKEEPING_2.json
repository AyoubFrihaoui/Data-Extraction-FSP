I could not have survived without her.\r\n\r\nWhile on vacation Rosa noticed one of my dogs was not doing well. She took her to the vet and we discovered she had diabetes. She was able to care for her until I got back and continues to do so as I travel frequently. She gives her insulin, walks and feeds her.  She treats my dog so well that my dog now prefers to be with her! This dog is now blind and has arthritis and Rosa continues to take loving care of her. I have another dog that is difficult. He does not obey commands and has frequent eye and ear infections. Rosa is very patient with him. Rosa treats my pets like they were members of her own family. \r\n\r\nRosa helped me to run my household and raise my son as well. She cleaned did errands and took my son places when I was not in town. She had a key to my home. I trust her implicitly. She has became a member of my family. ",
