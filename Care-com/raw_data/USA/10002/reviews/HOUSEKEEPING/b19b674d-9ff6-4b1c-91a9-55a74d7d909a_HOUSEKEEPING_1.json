Having someone with in my house and with my kids could be a bit scary but she quickly eased my fears and became a reliable staple in my life. \n\nAs a baby sitter she took great care of my kids. She was always attentive to their needs and went above and beyond with preparing healthy meals, keeping their toys clean and organized and taking them to extra curricular activities. I truly never had to worry while my kids were with her as I knew they were in good hands. My kids are now school age and continue to ask about her constantly. She has become family at this point. \n\nAs a cleaner she is extremely detailed and reliable. She is very professional in her work and does not cut any corners. She is also very flexible which has come in handy many times when I've needed an extra clean from having people over or for events. I am so extremely grateful for her and would recommend her to anyone.  ",
