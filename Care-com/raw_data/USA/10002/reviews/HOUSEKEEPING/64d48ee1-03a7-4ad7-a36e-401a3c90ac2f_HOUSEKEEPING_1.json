She is kind, loving, energetic, dependable and most importantly my son absolutely loves her. \r\n\r\nShe has more energy than I ever will, and makes sure that our son always feels safe and loved. She helped  him establish consistent routines, preps him healthy meals, and keeps him occupied and busy during the day at the playground and with activities and classes. Not only that, she helps keep our home tidy throughout the day and helps with washing bottles, folding laundry, and organizing the nursery. There is nothing better than walking home from a long day at work to a clean home and a happy, smiling baby. \r\n\r\nWe're forever grateful for the care, company and love that she has shown. Her next family will be truly lucky to have her!",
