            "displayText": "Taylor is so kind and wonderful to work with! I've hired her for an ongoing basis to help fold and put away laundry, and help with light dishes if needed as well as child care. For the laundry and dishes job she was so helpful! She understood where everything needed to go after me walking through it once with her, she was speedy with her time, and flexible if I needed help with other tasks. (most recently some light crafts for the kids' Halloween parties).\r\n\r\nIn terms of child care I feel so grateful to have found her. She is the first sitter outside of our friends and family that we have had since our beloved nanny, and the kids absolutely adored her (We have a 3 and a 6 yo) . For a date night sitting job she made pizza with them, played games with them, and was able to help with the bedtime routine.\r\n\r\nShe has her own car and we might have her help with pick up from school and activities in the future. We adore her and I highly recommend Taylor!",
