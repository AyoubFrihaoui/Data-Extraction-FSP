            "originalText": "Unfortunately, I have to give Adele 2 stars. My experience was not in the least the greatest. Besides her somewhat pleasant personality and showing up a bit earlier than expected despite a lot of schedule changes on my part, I cannot say the 2 stars are even deserving. I hired Adele to clean my father’s 2 bedroom 1 bath apartment. We spoke on the phone and texted, I sent her videos as requested and received a checklist. Everything seemed great even up until she arrived and did her own walk through and quoted me an additional $100 (bringing her requested total to $400). I was not pleased but willing to pay her asking price based off of her plan of action to tackle the cleaning. There was a lot happening in my dad’s home so I knew if I wanted a deep thorough cleaning it would cost. I left her to do her job because she told me she liked to zone in and I didn’t want to be in her way so I left her in the home and checked in twice prior to returning. When I returned she only cleaned 3 of the 5 rooms of the home. 2 of which she was still finishing and all 3 rooms I looked over and needed to request she complete a task. The living room and second bedroom was untouched. Not sure what took place during the 5hrs when I was away, but cleaning was not one of them. There must have also been some miscommunication because she did not believe she should have cleaned all the rooms of the apartment at the price she requested. I really wish I had better things to write but I returned the next day with my sister to clean the home and needed to go over her work. Even down to the faucet and handles on the bathroom sink along with the toilet seat not being cleaned. I feel she tried to take advantage of me and I still paid her more than the job she did required. It is very unfortunate as I enjoyed our initial interaction and wanted to hire someone for his frequent home upkeep and possibly my home as well. ",
