Emma did a thorough cleaning job in a portion of the time it took my previous housekeeper. She moved the furniture to clean underneath and moved everything on all the surfaces. My fiance and I are extremely happy with the immaculate condition she left the apartment in. Emma is very polite, hard working, and she's great at what she does - she needs very little guidance. I'd highly recommend her!",
