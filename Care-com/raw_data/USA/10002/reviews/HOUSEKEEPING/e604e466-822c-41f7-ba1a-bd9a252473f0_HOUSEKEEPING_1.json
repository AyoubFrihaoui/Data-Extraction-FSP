Maribel has treated her as one of her own kids, has taken her to classes, the library, the playground... she is very interactive, never on her phone, very reliable and flexible with her time. She doesn't like to be idle, so during nap time she will make your apartment spotless and do all your laundry. She was the only nanny we interviewed that saw our 5 floor walk up as a fun challenge, not a burden (we since moved). \r\nIn short, you will be lucky to have Maribel in your family!",
