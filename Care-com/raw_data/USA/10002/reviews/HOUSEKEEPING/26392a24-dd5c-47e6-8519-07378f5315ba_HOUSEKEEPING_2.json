After her very first visit to our home it honestly was cleaner than when we moves into it a little over a year ago! Without hesitation, I set up reoccurring visits with her! She is trustworthy to the extent that during that first visit I felt completely comfortable to leave the house with her there with a worry! She comes during the week when I am at work, I do not have to worry that my two indoor dogs will \"escape\" as we trust her to let them outside and back inside when she is finished! As soon as I am able to get her a spare key, she will have it! Her work is so thorough my Mom insisted I ask Renata to help her  with her two story home. Which she did another OUTSTANDING job on! She is a pleasure to be around and my one year old just loves her! I highly recommend everyone to use Renata!!!! I am thankful for care.com connecting me with this wonderful addition to our busy lives!!",
