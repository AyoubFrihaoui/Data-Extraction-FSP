She was so respectful of the needs and feelings of my son, and was mindful that the changes in his room must enhance how he wants to relax and entertain, and with respect for his way of \"organizing\"!  Ursula knows how to deep clean without chemicals and is skilled at creating a healthy and safe living environment (i.e. where and how dust settles, how the chords and circuit breakers should lie and where the fire extinguisher should go.)  My son arrived home and was shocked and overwhelmed with joy that each room flows much more easily and works for how we live.  I cannot wait for Ursula to return for our next project.
