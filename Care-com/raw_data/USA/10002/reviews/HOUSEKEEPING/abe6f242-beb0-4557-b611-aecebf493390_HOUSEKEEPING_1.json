Our daughter loves to be outside and Betania refused to take her outside. I had to repeatedly ask her to take our daughter outside for some fresh air and she constantly made excuses why she could not. We even bought a lighter stroller to make things easier. I quickly realized she was just lazy and wanted to just sit and watch on the couch and watch my daughter play inside all day. Betania was always on her phone and I even caught her sleeping on the job. I did speak to her about how she cannot stay inside all day and my concerns. Shortly after that conversation she said she was not coming back and gave us no notice after using all her sick days which we paid her out for. She might be OK for babysitting for a night but is not reliable or professional as a full time nanny especially if you want her to be active with your child.",
