I hire her three times and she was a life saver each time. When I had to move she helped me organize all of my things into boxes, clean the apartment and then helped me organize everything into my place. Recently she helped me organize all of my clothes and assist with cleaning and organizing my dresser drawers and closets. She pays attention to detail and goes above and beyond anticipating what needs to be done. You will not be disappointed with Natela! She's a wonderful person and fabulous household assistant!",

She worked with G daily on building independence and meeting developmental goals. Natela was always looking for new toys and activities to do with G to learn and be creative. Natela is also very intuitive to G's schedule. G looked forward to her time with Natela each day and would run to her stroller to get ready for her arrival.
