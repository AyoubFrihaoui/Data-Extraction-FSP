Now that my children are older we no longer require Lorena's support, but can wholeheartedly and highly recommend her to a busy family in need of a loving, caring and dedicated nanny and/or efficient and thorough housekeeper. \r\n \r\nWhen Lorena joined us seven years ago, my children, then aged 4, 6 and 8 years old, fell in love with her within weeks. Lorena has always shown great kindness and love towards them. She is a very patient, kind and gentle person; she is very obliging and willing to be flexible when schedules change at the last minute. She has transported my children over the years around the city on the subway, in taxis and Ubers. She always puts safety first - she calls or texts to check in with me when she departs and when she reaches her destination. Lorena ensures homework gets done when I?m not home and keeps the girls on schedule, packs snacks for them when on the go and cooks dinner for them when they get home. As a mother herself, Lorena knows intuitively what children need when in her care; she is able to balance those needs with sound judgment while always mindful of parental instruction when she is in charge. Lorena is adept at keeping play dates on track, delivering and picking up on time to birthday parties, swim lessons, music etc. She is a highly organized and smart person, is attuned to and aware of daily and weekly schedules, and knows just how to support a busy NY family. \r\n \r\nOn the housekeeping front, Lorena has kept my apartment in pristine condition on a daily basis while juggling childcare and keeping up with the mounds of laundry and ironing that three girls create! She is detail oriented and quick to learn how a household runs and the specific needs and habits of a particular family.\r\n \r\nOn a personal level, it has been wonderful to have Lorena in our lives, her excellent care of my girls, her attention to detail, her attentiveness, discretion and loyalty are character traits that I can attest to. She is an active member of her church and wonderful mother to three teenagers and, despite her personal commitments, has always been extremely obliging, flexible, punctual and rarely misses a day of work.  \r\n \r\nPlease feel free to contact me should you require further information. I truly believe that Lorena will be an asset to any family looking for a responsible, loving, hardworking, honest and kind babysitter or housekeeper.",
