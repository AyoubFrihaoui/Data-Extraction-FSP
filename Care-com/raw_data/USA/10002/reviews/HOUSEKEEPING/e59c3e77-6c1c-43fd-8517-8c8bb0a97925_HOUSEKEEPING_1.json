Zaman was referred to us by a close friend and she has been an amazing caregiver ever since. I can trust her with child care especially in Covid era where human care is the hardest thing to find as she follows safety protocols. She helps her with her school assignments as well as keeps her fully engaged while we need to focus elsewhere. I would highly recommend her as a professional caregiver. Thanks Zaman.",
