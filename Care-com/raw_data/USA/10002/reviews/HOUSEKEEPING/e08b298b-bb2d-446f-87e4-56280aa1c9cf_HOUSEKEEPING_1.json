Every time I get home after she cleans I get that fresh house smell that I love. She is very caring and helpful with anything I ask her to. Always giving me advice on how to take care of things when I'm by myself and trying to help you find a solution for anything you talk to her even with my personal stuff.

Rosa was very patient with him as he got to know her. Since she has been walking with him, he is well-behaved and well-exercised every day, and he loves her! When my husband and I went away for a week, Rosa stopped by to walk him, feed him, and spend time with him a few times a day. It was a huge weight off my shoulders knowing that Kylo would be cared for by someone he knew in an environment that he was accustomed to.\r\n\r\nIn addition to walking the dog, Rosa also cleans the apartment for us once every other week. She does a thorough job, and it is so convenient.\r\n\r\nThank you so much, Rosa.  You have been a wonderful addition to our daily life!!",
