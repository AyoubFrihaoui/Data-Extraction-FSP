            "displayText": "Bridget has spent the last two years working for our family part-time caring for our young children. Bridget always arrived on time, prepared, and ready to work. As the kids got older, Bridget enjoyed safely taking our children on trips to the zoo, Stan Hywet, and to local playgrounds. Bridget and I had a trusting relationship and I considered her a member of our family. She is compassionate and calm. We managed childcare, discipline, and challenges that came as a team together. Bridget helped take our daughter to and from preschool. She helped with light housework and our dog. She also adhered to our kids' schedule, daily routine, and helped potty train both children. Due to the circumstances of the current pandemic and COVID-19, our family was not in the need of additional childcare. Any local family would be lucky to have Bridget care for their children and we will miss her!",
