He took good care of my 68-year old husband who has PSP and trouble keeping his balance. Andre took him to his physical therapy appointments via Uber, and helped him navigate with his walker.  He also helped with getting my husband to the bathroom, cleaning him and getting him in and out of his chair and bed.  Andre has a cheerful disposition and was very kind. When my husband was sleeping he was happy to help with household chores, sweeping and doing dishes. I did not have to ask him to do these things-- he just did them.  I recommend Andre.",
