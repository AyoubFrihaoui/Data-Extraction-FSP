She made me feel comfortable and accommodated all of my requests. She was very thorough and paid attention to details while she cleaned my 2 bedroom apartment and my rental. \r\n\r\nI met Marie when I was pregnant and she volunteered to go grocery shopping for me. She is really sweet to my 10 years old niece and daughter. She is very caring and offered excellent maternal advice and after my delivery she visited me and cooked the most delicious beef soup I've ever eaten. \r\nMarie is a gem and excellent cook. My family is glad to have her working for us. I met her through Care.com\r\nThanks Marie I am so happy I found you!",
