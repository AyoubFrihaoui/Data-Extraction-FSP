But Karima has excellent personable skills, knows exactly what to do, takes initiative, has good organizational skills and is eager to please. She also works fast but is very thorough. She is a natural. The service she helped me with is housekeeping and I would highly recommend her in that area, and is likely also a terrific candidate to do the other services offered on this site.
