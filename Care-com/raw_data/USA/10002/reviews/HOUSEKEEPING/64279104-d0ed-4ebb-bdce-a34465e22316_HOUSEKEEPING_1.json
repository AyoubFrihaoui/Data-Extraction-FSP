He absolutely adores her and we know he'll be devastated once we leave.  \r\n\r\nEvery morning/afternoon he gives her a huge hug, smiles and babbles.\r\n\r\nWe can't say enough good things about Lafleur, she came to us with 20 years of experience, excellent references and stood out amongst all the nannies we interviewed. She's trustworthy, reliable, patient, nurturing, diligent and amazing with newborns. We're never worried leaving home because we know our son is in great hands. She keeps our home spotless and perfectly organized.\r\n\r\nShe will be an excellent addition to your family.\r\n\r\nWe are more than happy to provide a great reference!",
