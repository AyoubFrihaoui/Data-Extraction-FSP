And I really appreciate this.\r\nShe comes in after lunch and gets the kitchen clean,  organized and ready for dinner. Then, she will perfectly chop and dice and slice any vegetables I might need for cooking that night or the next day. She prepares amazing sauces and dressings and anything else I need or want. \r\nIn addition to food prepping, she has done grocery shopping and even watched the kids for us when we needed. Her flexibility is a huge asset, and her positive attitude adds to the environment for the kids. \r\nTo sum it up, Jessica is timely, efficient, and resourceful in finding ways to provide value, and I'd highly recommend her services.",
