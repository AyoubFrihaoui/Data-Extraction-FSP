She was proactive with taking my children to the park everyday, ensuring they ate well with snacks.  She has a great personality, is kind, and very interactive with my children.  I knew she would read and play with them, encouraged good manners and for them to eat (both picky...).  More importantly she was patient with my son who at the time required much more attention.  She was such a pleasure, I would 100% recommend her and hire her again with absolutely no reservations.",
