            "displayText": "I have known Ursula B. for seven years as a friend and colleague.  We worked cooperatively at Church, Book Store events and various fund-raising activities.  Ursula is intelligent, trustworthy, positive and very organized.  She works well with groups, individuals and also independently.  I admire her effectiveness in using her \"people-skills\" regarding her interactions.  Ursula is an attentive listener and effective communicator.  She has thoroughly demonstrated her skills in prep. work and cleaning at church and public events.  Ursula is great with time management, running errands and always is willing to complete tasks with focus and efficiency.  She is proactive and is naturally willing to go the distance in accomplishing what is needed and always adds value.  I highly recommend Ursula B. for the position she is seeking.  She will bring the right motivation, dedication and focus to her next job. Respectfully submitted by Carol E.",
