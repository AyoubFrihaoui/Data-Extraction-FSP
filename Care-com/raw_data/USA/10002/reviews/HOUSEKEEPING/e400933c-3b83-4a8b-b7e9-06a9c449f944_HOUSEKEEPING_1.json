She keeps her company, helps with her day to day activities and although difficult with advanced dementia she makes sure she is clean, fed and her house is kept spotless. My Mother's final wishes were to remain in her home and because of Adriana we are able to do this so I can continue working knowing my Mother is in caring hands.  Adriana is organized and punctual and provides me with updates and pictures whenever necessary. Any family would be lucky to have her caring for their senior loved one.",
