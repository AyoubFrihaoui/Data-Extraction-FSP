However, when I needed to find someone through care.com to care for my dog, Cooper, amidst a busy schedule, I decided to take a chance on Misha based on her highly recommended reviews—and I'm glad I did. From our initial meeting, Misha's professionalism and genuine compassion immediately put me at ease. Despite my initial reservations, Misha took the time to understand Cooper's routine and personality, ensuring he felt comfortable and loved in her care. Cooper is pretty picky and doesn't take a liking to just anyone. i was truly impressed by his judgement.  Her regular updates and photos throughout the day were not only reassuring but also a testament to her dedication. I'm grateful for Misha's outstanding service. She's more than just a dog walker; she's a true animal lover. I wholeheartedly recommend Misha to anyone seeking exceptional pet care. With cooper taking a liking to her seemingly warm spirit, I look forward to booking her again for possible Pet sitting, walking again and a doggy playdate with her pup summer! Thank you again, Misha. You have been awesome! ",

Seeing how well-trained and gentle Summer was, even functioning as a service dog, reassured me of Misha's abilities and care. The play date allowed me to witness firsthand how attentive and responsible Misha is with both her own dog and mine.\n\nWhen I eventually had to leave town for a week, Misha continued to impress. She sent regular updates and photos, letting me know how my dog was doing and providing peace of mind. I was so glad I gave Misha a chance—she exceeded my expectations in every way. I have to consistently do long travels for work and she is the only person I let walk my dog.  highly recommend Misha to anyone seeking reliable and compassionate pet care.",
