From the very first day, she demonstrated a strong work ethic, attention to detail, and a friendly demeanor that made her a joy to have in my home.\n\nGulisa is incredibly thorough in her cleaning. She tackled areas that I didn’t even think to address, and the difference in my home’s cleanliness was immediately noticeable. She is also very organized and efficient, completing tasks in a timely manner without compromising on quality.\n\nMoreover, Gulisa is respectful and trustworthy. I feel completely at ease leaving her in my home when I’m not there. She has a great attitude and is always willing to go the extra mile, whether it’s doing a special request or providing helpful tips on maintaining a tidy space.\n\nCommunication with Gulisa has been seamless; she is always prompt in responding and open to feedback. I appreciate her flexibility in scheduling, which has made it easy to work around my busy life.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Gulisa as a housekeeper. Her professionalism, reliability, and dedication to her work have made a significant positive impact on my household. I look forward to continuing to work with her!",
