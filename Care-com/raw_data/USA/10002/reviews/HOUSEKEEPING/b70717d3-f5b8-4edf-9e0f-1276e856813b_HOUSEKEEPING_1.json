I was not in town so I needed someone who could be trusted to take full control of the move, Bruna was awesome. She was very communicative with her schedule and how long she thought the project would take. She went above and beyond by selling many of the items we needed to find new homes for, and coordinating pickups with the buyers. She is a true self starter and handled the entire project on her own.  I would hire her again and recommend her to anyone who needs a reliable and trust worthy person for their home or business projects.",
