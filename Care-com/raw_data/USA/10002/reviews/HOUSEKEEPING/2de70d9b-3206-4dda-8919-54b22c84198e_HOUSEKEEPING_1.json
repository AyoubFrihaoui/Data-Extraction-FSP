Our home went from feeling like a family camping ground to a 4 star hotel. Our apartment is a tricky duplex with a lot of odd angles plus we have two very active (code for mess-making) little boys. Sijana took exquisite care cleaning everything with utmost attention to detail. For the next few days, we would find things she cleaned: for example, our coffee pot was stain-free, the step-stool the boys use to reach the sink was scrubbed fresh as the day we bought it. On top of being such a hard worker and through housekeeper, she is very charming woman. I even took conference calls in our bedroom while she worked and she was perfectly sensitive to making sure I was undisturbed. Overall we feel very lucky to have Sijana bring such a high level of freshness to our home. I'm recommending her to all of my friends.",
