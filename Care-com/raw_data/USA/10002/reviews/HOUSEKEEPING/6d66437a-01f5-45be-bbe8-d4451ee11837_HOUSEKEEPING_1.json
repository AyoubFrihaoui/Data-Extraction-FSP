She started working for us when my daughters were 4 and 2 1/2 and my son was 4 days old. My children love her very much.\r\n\r\nThere are so many positive things to say about Samanthia. She was very good and loving to the children. She did her job well, getting them to school and back, going to the park, library and after school activities. She is a very calm and patient person. She also helped out with cooking/preparing food for our children, keeping the house neat and clean, etc. She has always been very reliable and dependable. \r\n\r\nI'd really like to help her find a good family to work with. Please contact me if you'd like more information.",
