            "displayText": "To Whom It May Concern:\r\nIt is with great enthusiasm that I write this letter of recommendation for Rosa, whom I have known and employed for more than 10 years. \r\nShe is a hard-working, honest and dependable woman who always went above and beyond in her work. I had a large, two-bedroom condo in Jersey City and I trusted Rosa completely and gave her a key to my home and left her on her own to work unsupervised while I was at work, or traveling for work.  She was caring and kind when my elderly parents were visiting, providing little touches to make the two more comfortable. On one occasion, she alerted me to my father's illness, so I was able to quickly get him to the hospital. She has a very gentle, caring way about her.\r\nRosa's official title was that of my housekeeper. In addition to regular weekly visits and general cleaning, when she saw things around the house that needed doing, she simply rolled up her sleeves and got to work. From watering plants to polishing silver, Rosa did it all, and did it extremely well. Everything in my home was cleaned when she was done. \r\nA few years ago, I moved to New Providence, NJ, and although it isn't convenient for Rosa to continue to work with me on a weekly basis due to travel, I still hire her for special occasions, to work parties and help with big projects around my home here.  \r\nI have recommended her to a number of my friends over the years, and have never had anything but a positive response from people who have had her work for them. \r\nI recommend her without any reservations and would be happy to speak personally with anyone considering employing her.\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJulia",
