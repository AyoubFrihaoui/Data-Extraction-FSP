In the space of a week (we were just visiting NYC) she quickly picked up on our 25 month old's preferences and even small nuances that we hadn't yet noticed. Our son even learned her name and he's only just started speaking!  we had originally only booked her for a few nights but ended up asking her to come almost nightly as we felt so safe with her watching our little one. We are keeping her number for next year; we are so happy to have found her. Highly recommend!",
