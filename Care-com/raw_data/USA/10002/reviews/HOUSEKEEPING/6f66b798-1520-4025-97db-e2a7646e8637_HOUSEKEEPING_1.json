She's a second mom to the kids as she would also be on a lookout if they were treated well by others and ensure they were always safe, confident and healthy. \r\n\r\nShe's also really fun and sociable, which allowed our kids to make a group of new friends around the neighborhood - we always joke that our kids have more friends than we do!
