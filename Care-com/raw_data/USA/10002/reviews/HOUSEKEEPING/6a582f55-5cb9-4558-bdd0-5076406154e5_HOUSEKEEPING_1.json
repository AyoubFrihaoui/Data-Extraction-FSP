She was cleaning my 2bedroom/2.5 bathroom condo for 4 hours, the place looked organized; however, I got disappointed such basic things as the stove and the microwave she left dirty, she didn't clean them at all. Fridge doors had oily smudges. Also, she was planning to leave the place without mopping until I asked her if she had mopped, so she mopped after my comment quickly before leaving.",
