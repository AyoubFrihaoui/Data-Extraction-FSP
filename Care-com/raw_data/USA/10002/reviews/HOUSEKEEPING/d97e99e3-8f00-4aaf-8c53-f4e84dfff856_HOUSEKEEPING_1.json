            "displayText": "Nogaye had been a wonderful care taker and nanny for our daughter. From age 1-2, she worked with us full-time and developed a strong bond with her as they played, adventured and learned on a daily basis. We were so proud of our daughter who showed us new things she experiences. As bilingual parents, Nogaye did a wonderful job of teaching our daughter both English and French. And Nogaye's focus on teach has helped her develop far beyond her age level in both, speaking and conceptual understanding. Because of this, she is proving to be a leader amongst her peers. They were very active together, going to play dates, museums, libraries, sing-a-longs, playgrounds and children's group activities throughout the neighborhood everyday. Nogaye had so much energy to give, that our daughter missed her dearly on the weekends. She also was very effective at helping us with potty training and bottle weaning. We could not have done it without her.\r\n\r\nNogaye was also very helpful in fulfilling household duties revolving around our daughter from cleaning floors, dishes, cooking, and laundry. She was always very punctual, trustworthy and willing to put in extra hours when we were trapped at work.",
