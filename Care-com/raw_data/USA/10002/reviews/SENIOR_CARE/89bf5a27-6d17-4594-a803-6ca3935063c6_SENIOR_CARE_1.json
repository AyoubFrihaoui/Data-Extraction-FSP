My mother recently passed away after a slow decline from dementia.  She was objectively speaking a difficult patient in many ways.  Yaa was the only person who found just the right way to handle her, care for her and connect with her.  Yaa leads with love and care in addition to her skills and diligence.  Yaa helped my brother and I keep a non-stop vigil in the last week of my mother's life.  She was with us to the end. I hope that Yaa and her beautiful family will always be connected to our family.
