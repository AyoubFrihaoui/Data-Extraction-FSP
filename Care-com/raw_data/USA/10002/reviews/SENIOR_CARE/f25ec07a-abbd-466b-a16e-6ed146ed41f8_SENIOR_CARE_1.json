            "displayText": "Irma was like family.  I had hired Irma to work for my Uncle 2 years ago and she has been with us since.  I live in California and he lives in NY.  Irma was amazing with my uncle and took care of him like family.  She is one of the sweetest, kindest, most patient women I know.  My uncle is 92 and at times a little strong willed.  But Irma worked with him every step of they way, and never had an unkind word to say.  Always went above and beyond with the kindest heart and gentle sole.  No matter what was going on she always was on time, ready to work, got things completely done and never left without a kind word to my uncle.  Irma knowing that I was so far away would always keep me updated on my uncle's needs if any and condition.  It is with a heavy heart that my uncle has had an unfortunate accident and I will now need to move him out to me.  But I would Highly Recommend Irma to any family looking to have a wonderful, loving and trustworthy person to work for them.  We will miss you!",
