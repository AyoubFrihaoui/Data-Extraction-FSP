Natalie  is compassionate, caring and extremely trustworthy. She managed  bedside and individual care to my “Aunt” and “Uncle” who were in their 90’s for 6 years.   Preparing fresh meals, administering medication, accompanying them to doctor visits, feeding, bathing, dressing and always ensuring they were comfortable. Natalie also took care of day-to-day household maintenance, such as cleaning, changing bed linens, doing the laundry and food shopping.  Their home was always neat and clean. She was a great comfort to my “Aunt” during my “Uncle’s” final days. Natalie continued to take care of my “Aunt” after her brother’s passing. She lifted her spirits by taking time to chat and watch TV together and just provided my “Aunt” with the extra attention needed to help ease the loss of her brother.  She made my “Aunt” feel special.  During my “Aunt’s” final days with Hospice care, Natalie continued to be by my “Aunt’s” side comforting her as she made her final journey.  I do hope you will consider Natalie for a position as a caregiver. I am confident that you will be happy with her caregiving as her family was.  ",
