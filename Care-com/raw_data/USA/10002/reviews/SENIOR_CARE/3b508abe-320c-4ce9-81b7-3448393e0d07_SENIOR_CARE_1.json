She is professional and very dependable; always attentive and willing to change with the needs of the family.  Dee has a great rapport with my parents, especially my father, who suffers from lewy body dementia. She just knows how to navigate his sometimes difficult and ever-changing moods. Overall Iâ€™d say Dee has a genuine heart and provides top-notch care.   I highly recommend her!  Actually I wish she could stay with us longer. Thanks Dee!!",

Above all, Dee is a professional. My sister is a very difficult person to care for. She has a neurocognitive disorder which makes her irritable, verbally insulting, and uncooperative. At all times, Dee maintained a professional demeanor and never took my sister's offensive  behavior personally. I found this incredible because I was offended by my sister's behavior. Dee was always punctual and dependable. She followed instructions well and always contacted me when she had questions or when something happened at the facility about which she thought I should know. Dee is the kind of caregiver to whom you can entrust the care of your loved one because she takes her job seriously, acts  responsibly, and cares for her client compassionately. I was always confident that my sister would receive excellent care while Dee was on the job. I highly recommend Dee as a caregiver without reservation. If you have questions about Dee, ask her for my phone number and I will tell you more.",
