We were fortunate to have Nino care for her from November 1, 2005, until her passing in June of 2007, and I highly recommend her services. Although it was a while ago, we still maintain a good relationship with Nina, staying in touch sometimes.\n\nDuring this period, Nino not only attended to my mother's physical needs but also managed household chores, prepared meals, and ensured Mom remained mentally and physically active. Her professionalism and round-the-clock availability allowed us to enjoy our time with Mom without constant worry.\n\nDespite the challenging decision between home care and institutionalization, Nino's compassionate care affirmed that keeping Mom at home was the right choice. Nino also formed a close bond with my Aunt, further cementing her place in our family.",
