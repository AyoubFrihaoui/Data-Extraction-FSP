She was diligent, attentive and totally professional. In discussing her duties, I learned that she has skills which my husband doesn't require but if your situation requires greater medical attention by a caregiver, I strongly recommend contacting Debra to discuss your needs and how she can help you fulfill them. She was a great communicator and very responsive, which was extremely helpful given this was a last-minute urgent need on our side.",
