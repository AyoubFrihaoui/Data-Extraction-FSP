My family and I had 3 interviews with Marilyn and she confirmed that she would accept the position and agreed to the start date. We then paused our hiring efforts and turned down other wonderful candidates because Marilyn confirmed that she would be starting with my family.  We NEVER heard back from her! We sent emails and texts for 3 days and she never responded to one message. How foolish that for the first 2 days of not hearing back, we were actually worried that something happened to her because she sounded so  wonderful during the interviews. By the 3rd day we saw her true side and gave up reaching out to her. \n\nPlease take this into consideration when you think about hiring this woman. How kind and compassionate will she really be when caring for your loved one?\n\nAnd yes, she did provide me with 4 references, and interestingly enough, only 1 of them called me back. It was a good reference -- but from many years ago. Clearly Marilyn's priorities have changed since then. A simple text or phone call to let us know that she changed her mind would've been greatly appreciated. But she didn't even have enough consideration to do that. \n\nThis shows the true charachter of this woman, so please use this as a warning when thinking about hiring her to take care of your loved one.",
