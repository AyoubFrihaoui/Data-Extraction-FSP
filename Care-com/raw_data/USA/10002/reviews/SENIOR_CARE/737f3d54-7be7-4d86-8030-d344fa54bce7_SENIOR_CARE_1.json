Klara always had fun activities to make sure her mind was occupied and stayed sharp as well did proper exercises with her to keep her mobility as much as possible! Unfortunately my Mom passed but if I would need Klara again, I would not hesitate to hire her or  even recommend her to anyone: for a care of a baby or an elderly person. They would be very happy and satisfied that they have her!\r\nKlara is a very caring, always ready to help person who is very passionate about her job and responsibilities. If I could, I would give her 10 stars. :-)",
