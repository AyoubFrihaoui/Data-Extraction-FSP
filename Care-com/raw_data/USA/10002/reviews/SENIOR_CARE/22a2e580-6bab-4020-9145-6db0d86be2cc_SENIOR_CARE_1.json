            "originalText": "My mother was 80 years old  and bedridden.  She required assistance with most of her activities of daily living skills.  Fatou was responsive, attentive and provided excellent care. She went above and beyond her duties providing our family with information and suggesting treatments to discuss with my mothers primary care physician often with good results.  Fatou made my mother feel special. She found out her favorite meal and made it for her for her birthday. She rearranged her personal schedule to be present and provide care and assistance for my mother when the physical therapist was present. Ahead of her month long vacation she arranged for her friend to care for my mother. She was equally as good as Fatou.  My mother became ill, was hospitalized and eventually moved to hospice care. She was non responsive, but it didn’t matter. Fatou and her friend visited my mother and assisted the nursing staff in caring for her.  It was our family’s great fortune to have found Fatou via Care.com. My mother and our family appreciated and are thankful to Fatou. She was a Godsend to our mother as I know she will be to others in her care. ",
