Being bed-bound, it needed a lit if physical efforts to take care if him alone. But, Junrill made it possible to render quality care up to the last days of the patient. He was very attentive to his needs and the wife and the rest of the family were so impressed with him. His compassion went beyond and above rendering that excellent service up to the patient's last breath. If ever a new patient would ask for an Aide's service, Junrill is the 1st one that comes into my mind because he will keep up to somebody's expectations all the time. ",
