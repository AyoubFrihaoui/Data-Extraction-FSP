From the first day, it was clear from Kathleen’s professionalism, empathy and character that my mom was in excellent hands. Furthermore, Kathleen helped us to coordinate with 2 other caregivers that she works with on a regular basis so that we had comprehensive coverage for my mom. Everyone that Kathleen introduced us to was best-in-class and embody both a clear work ethic and compassion that stems from putting their clients first. Having a team that worked together seamlessly was a real blessing for us and the level of care that I saw with Kathleen was unparalleled in the 10+ years that I’ve been working with various caregivers to find support for my mom while she lived alone. It’s without hesitation that I recommend Kathleen and I would work with her again in a heartbeat should the need arise. ",
