She is a special person.She is  very well known in Georgian community for her kindness and compassion. Nino has been my best friend since childhood. We both came to America 25 years ago when we were very young. We faced many tough times together and always helped each other. I also worked in eldercare for a long time, Nino and I have worked together many times as caregivers, and we made a great team. She's always adept at handling tough situations, and both the elderly and their families adore her. She is a very trustworthy and honest person; you can rely on her for help or support whenever needed. Additionally, Nino is an excellent cook, and I love her food. I highly recommend her to anyone in need of a caregiver for their loved ones.",

We were fortunate to have Nino care for her from November 1, 2005, until her passing in June of 2007, and I highly recommend her services. Although it was a while ago, we still maintain a good relationship with Nina, staying in touch sometimes.\n\nDuring this period, Nino not only attended to my mother's physical needs but also managed household chores, prepared meals, and ensured Mom remained mentally and physically active. Her professionalism and round-the-clock availability allowed us to enjoy our time with Mom without constant worry.\n\nDespite the challenging decision between home care and institutionalization, Nino's compassionate care affirmed that keeping Mom at home was the right choice. Nino also formed a close bond with my Aunt, further cementing her place in our family.",
