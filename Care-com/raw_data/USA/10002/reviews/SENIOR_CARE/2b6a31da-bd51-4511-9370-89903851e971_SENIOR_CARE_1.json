She helped us understand each other’s points of view in a respectful and compassionate way. She was very kind and patient with my father-in-law during his difficult time undergoing cancer treatments. She was with him day and night, serving as a great companion and nurse. Our family had peace of mind knowing he was in good hands with Buka. She took him out for strolls, watched movies with him, cooked his favorite food. Additionally, she was very diligent about his doctor’s appointments and made sure all his medications were taken on time. She is the only person I would ever recommend to my family and friends. ",
