            "displayText": "",
            "originalText": "Larry is a uniquely delightful, good-natured, and generally wonderful person. The reference calls I had with three of his former employers were some of the most effusive I have ever heard. He is very dependable, kind, and skilled in what he does. Caregiving is a true vocation for him.\n\nAs is obvious from all of his other reviews here on Care.com, Larry is a 5-star person. Now, he *would* have a perfect 5-star profile, were it not for one person who rather maliciously wrote him a one-star \"review\" back in 2021, filled with outlandishly false claims about his personality, intelligence, and work ethic. When I first interviewed Larry, I directly asked him about this one bad review, to understand exactly what that was all about. Without hesitating at all, he calmly, simply told me what had happened, in his trademark gentle and very respectful way of doing and saying things.\n\nNow, Larry shrugs off that untrue, one-star review. He harbors no grudges, and moves forward, preferring to focus on the good in people. He is one of those rare people who \"leads with love\". He is too honorable to address those horrible claims made against him, as he would never want to dishonor another person, even in response to that person having dishonored him. He \"turns the other cheek\" as it were, and goes with Grace wherever he goes.\n\nBut Larry deserves so much better than having that mean review, riddled with untruths, live on his profile forever. His kindness was completely taken advantage of. So I am going to use my review to tell the story of what actually happened. \n\nNow to be clear, Larry has NOT asked me to do this, and this is all put into my own words:\n\nBasically, that one-star-review person had hired Larry for a job as a caregiver and then began --almost immediately-- using him also as a kind of servant and making him do all kinds of jobs and tasks that were totally outside of the scope of work of what had been discussed when he agreed to take the job. Ever the helper, Larry still did all that was asked, and as much as he could. Then, this person started making inappropriate advances towards him, which he repeatedly declined as nicely as he possibly could. She did not take this rejection well and retaliated by firing him and then posting an incredibly horrible (and, let's be honest, pretty racist) review.\n\nBelow I will refute that untrue and defamatory one-star \"review\", breaking it down phrase by phrase:  \n\n1) \"While Larry is a \"nice\" guy, he lacks the skill set he presents on Care.com and speaks to\" --> This is false. Larry is very skilled and experienced in caregiving. He has many references that can attest to this.\n\n2) \"Moreover, he does not have the aptitude to grasp basic housekeeping and home maintenance concepts.\" --> This is an incorrect statement that is also (let's be honest) laced with racism. Larry is intelligent, well-spoken, and has more than enough \"aptitude\" for maintaining a household, among many other skills. This comment was a baseless, libelous attack on his person.\n\n3) \"Despite applying significant patience to the situation, creating a step by step guide to our home and giving him the time and space to learn, I found that he did not listen, did not respond to feedback and would make the same mistakes over and over.\" --> These are, to put it simply, ridiculous claims. Larry is an excellent listener, a fast learner, and flexible to meeting people's needs. Also, this person was clearly a rather difficult individual with a penchant for setting wildly unrealistic expectations.\n\n4) \"He ended up creating havoc -things lost, put in the wrong spot, stuff never getting cleaned, lying about work being done, taking an extraordinary amount of time to do basic tasks, etc.\" --> Larry does not lie. He just doesn't. He would never even fib. It's just not in his nature. And \"havoc\"? Really? All of these, wild accusations, all wildly untrue.\n\n5) \"I terminated his employment yesterday after he ran my car, with my mother and my child off the road causing damage.\" --> The situation that she -incorrectly- describes here was this: This person was making Larry do very servile work, including acting as a chauffeur for her mother and child, and basically just using him as a butler in addition to his caregiving duties. Which was wrong. He did not want to drive her car, but she made him do this as part of the job. At one point, the car broke down while he was driving it, and so he had to pull over off of the road, as any sane and responsible person would do, in order to keep everyone safe. He should never have been pressured into that kind of situation by his employer. Absolutely wrong. Also: Larry is an excellent driver and has worked as a chauffeur in the past -- In fact I spoke with that particular employer, who gave him a glowing review.\n\n6) \"I caution anyone who needs assistance beyond very basic, repetitive tasks from hiring him.\" --> Again, more racist undertones (overtones at this point, frankly), and she concludes her rant with a retaliatory attempt to try and effectively destroy Larry's ability to ever get another caregiving job on Care.com. Just horrific behavior overall. \n\nAs anyone can see, the tone in which that entire review was written was an emotional, erratic, and mean-spirited one. Not a reliable source whatsoever. \n\nLarry, I truly hope you don't mind my writing this all up and putting it on your profile for all to see. I just couldn't let that review go unrefuted. \n\nTo everyone who has been reading (and thank you for reading this in its entirety), I will simply end with this: \n\nLarry is a rare gem. Any family would be so incredibly lucky to have him join their team.\n\nThank you.",
