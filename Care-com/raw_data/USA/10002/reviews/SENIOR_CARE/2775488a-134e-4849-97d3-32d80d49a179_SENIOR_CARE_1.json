            "displayText": "I highly recommend Reyna as a caregiver. She took excellent care of my 78-year-old father for almost two years. During that time, she was always kind, affectionate and very loving to him. She would even call him on her days off to ensure he was doing well. We were very lucky to have found Reyna. She prepared nutritious and delicious meals; went food shopping for him; cleaned his home and washed his clothes; gave him his medications including insulin for his diabetes; took him to doctor appointments and ensured he was following the doctor's instructions including getting exercise (even when he didn't want to walk). Reyna is a hard worker who truly loves her job. She is trustworthy, dependable. patient, and always professional. Please consider hiring Reyna, you will be glad you did. We can't say enough good things about our experience with Reyna.",
