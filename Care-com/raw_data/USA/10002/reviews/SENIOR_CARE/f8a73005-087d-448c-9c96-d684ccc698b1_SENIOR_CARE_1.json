The best part of all of this is my 88 year grandmother LOVES her. Kristy is also very flexible and her response time is super duper quick. Kristy was given one task (just sit with my grandma and give her a companionship-maybe feed her if she’s sleep when I step out). Kristy has done more than that. I’ve left dishes in the sink and would come back to dishes clean as well as my grandmother being well taken care of. Kristy is worth every dollar spent and is God sent. Thank you Kristy. ",
