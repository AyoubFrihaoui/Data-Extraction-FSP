She was compassionate, understanding, flexible, knowledgeable, resourceful, and dependable.  She would come to our home as early in the morning as we needed her to so we could go to work with a clear mind, knowing my father-in-law was in caring and capable hands.  Jennifer quickly became a part of our family and even our anxious skittish dog fell in love with her.  She taught us a lot about taking care of my father-in-law and was by our side when he passed.  At a very difficult time, she was a rock, someone we could always count on.  We are very grateful to have had her in our life and miss her.  You will not regret hiring her.",
