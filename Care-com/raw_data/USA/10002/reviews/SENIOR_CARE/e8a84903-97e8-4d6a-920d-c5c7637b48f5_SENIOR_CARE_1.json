There are not enough words to describe Nadia.  She was very devoted to Dad, extremely reliable and cared very much about him.  She was very kind and compassionate, cooked very well American food and ran the house very well.  She is family to us. My Dad a lot of health issues and she was dedicated to the cause, she has a lot of knowledge.  She was with us to the end.  That says alot about her character.\nUnfortunately, my father passed away 10 days ago.  Any family would be very lucky to have her taken care of their loved one.",
