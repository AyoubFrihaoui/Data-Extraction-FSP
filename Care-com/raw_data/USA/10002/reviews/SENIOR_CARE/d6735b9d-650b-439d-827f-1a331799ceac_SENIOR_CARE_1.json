My sister and I live out of state, so finding someone we could count on was crucial, and that’s Victoria. She is so big-hearted, kind, dependable, thorough, and quite fascinating. She pulled my dad back from the brink of a sudden illness several times with her careful observations of his behavior changes, breathing issues, you name it.\nDad was bedridden, with Parkinsonian traits, Lewy body dementia, and incontinence. Along with 4 diaper changes a day, Victoria kept him bathed, well fed, and entertained with her company, she’s had an amazing life. \nDad had a lot of interests and Victoria always found new things on YouTube to keep him engaged. My Dad was really happy being so well taken care of, and he became a nicer man I think because of the kindness she gave.\nShe made so many of the arrangements to move Dad from the nursing home back to his apartment, she found and hired Dad’s other beloved caretaker and managed the work schedules, ordered the groceries.\nHaving gone through a string of caretakers who left us constantly on edge for the next no-show or worse, Victoria made us feel safe and sane, she was trustworthy, everyone who met her in our building told us what a gem we had.  What a gift she was. \n\n",

Victoria has a \nwealth of knowledge about eldercare and literally saved my father's life on several occasions by cueing in to his symptoms and acting quickly. She is passionate, brilliant and kept my dad well fed, entertained, clean and healthy. She is reliable 100 percent of the time. She hired and managed care takers when some moved on.
