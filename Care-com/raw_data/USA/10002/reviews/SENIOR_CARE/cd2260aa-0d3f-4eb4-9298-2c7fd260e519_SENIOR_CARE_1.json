She provided kind, compassionate care to my\r\nmother, who could not do anything for herself. My mother immediately liked her and was happy to\r\nhave Ana around. That was no easy feat. Ana was attentive, and detail-oriented, always watching for what my mother's needs were, and quick to take care of those needs, sometimes even before my\r\nmother knew she had them. Ana was consistent and complete in her reporting of what occurred on\r\neach shift, which I appreciated. She was also completely trustworthy, prompt, mature beyond her years,\r\nand always willing to cover for other caregivers. Ana's warmth and compassion for my mother, especially at the end of her life, is something I will never\r\nforget. I highly recommend Ana to any family.",

As my mother-in-law's Alzheimer's progressed, she became very difficult, but Ana has an easy, calming presence and she doesn't get ruffled. I am a nurse practitioner and found that Ana understood things very quickly. She was smart enough to know when to worry about something, and caught a urinary tract infection very early by picking up on tiny clues. I have no hesitation in recommending Ana for a caregiving position.",
