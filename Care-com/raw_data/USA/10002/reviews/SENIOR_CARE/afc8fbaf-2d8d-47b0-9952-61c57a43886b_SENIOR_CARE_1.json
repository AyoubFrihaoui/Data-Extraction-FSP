She began caring for both of my parents (90 yo, 91 yo) and stayed with us to care for Mom after Dad passed on and for me as I recovered from surgery.\nShe is compassionate and gentle. Alethea did an excellent job of keeping me informed of any challenges they were creating or experiencing. She works efficiently and quietly.  There were times she was so quiet I forgot she was in the house. Alethea is happiest when there is a lot to do for her charges. She also is very effective at guiding her clients to making better choices, like regularly completing their excercises and structuring their meals to having a heavier meal midday and a lighter meal during the evening. She was also flexible and willing to work with us when our regular schedule  changed. \n\nAlethea P is an excellent caregiver. She is a good and hard worker.",
