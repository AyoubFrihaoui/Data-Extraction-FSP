            "originalText": "Juranda was the primary caregiver of my oldest dear friend Dimir. He had dementia and died a few weeks ago. Juranda was the best thing that could happen to him. Under her care, he recovered so much, his doctor called it a miracle. She made sure he ate healthy and delicious food every day, she made sure he exercised, but most importantly she did everything with ease and humor and warmth. Her excellent medical qualification and her wonderful personality made all the difference. My friend was actually happy during the last years of his life, and this was all Juranda’s and her coworker’s doing. Juranda managed the shifts and organized his care with her coworker and she stayed on top of everything my friend needed. She truly became a much respected and loved member of Dimir’s family and friends. There are simply not enough words to express how thankful we all are for her care. ",
