This also happened to be during a bad time, Mom was very sick and ended up in the hospital the following week. We needed someone with feeding tube, breathing treatments, & transferring experience. Laura was great! She caught on immediately on the way we do things. She worked three over night shifts and two evenings. We found her to be honest, friendly, and dependable. I would definitely use Laura again if she was available, so I highly recommend her. ",
