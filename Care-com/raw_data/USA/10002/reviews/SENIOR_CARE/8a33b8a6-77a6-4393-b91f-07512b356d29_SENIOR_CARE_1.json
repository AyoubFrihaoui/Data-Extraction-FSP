I left for a week and felt quite comfortable leaving him in Marie's care.With her kind encouragement and firmness he has returned to independence.- using a walker and maneuvering by himself, eating, using bathroom, dressing without help. Marie was helpful in getting things on the internet which would be useful to him including an adjustable bidet for the toilet which she installed! She drives and used our car.We have her only  three times a week now to shower my husband. Marie has helped him return to independence which was his goal and as his wife my goal also.",
