Betty cared for my dad for 3 years from his earliest stages of dementia to his last day. Betty possesses all of the skills, passion, patience and dedication that anyone could ask for to take care of a loved one. She handled all of the day to day necessities that my dad needed to maintain his quality of life, which became progressively more difficult as his condition worsened. She handled everything from taking him for activities, meals, medicine and hygiene to incontinence care. But even more amazing than the way she cared for him, was that she became his most trusted companion, and there are no words than can express what that meant to us. Despite his debilitating disease Betty was able to provide my dad with the highest quality of life both physically and emotionally and he remained happy to his last day. She became nothing less than a caring family member. Her kindness and integrity is priceless and I give Betty my highest recommendation. I say with absolute conviction that any family in need of a caregiver for a loved one would be very fortunate and blessed to have her. ",
