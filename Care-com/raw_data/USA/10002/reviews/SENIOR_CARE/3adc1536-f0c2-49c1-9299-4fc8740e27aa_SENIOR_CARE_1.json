She texted us 40 minutes before she was supposed to arrive to say she was sick and couldn’t make it. We understood so delayed her start date for the following week.She confirmed the day before, but again didn’t show up and didn’t respond to our calls. Don’t trust her. Unreliable & unprofessional.",
