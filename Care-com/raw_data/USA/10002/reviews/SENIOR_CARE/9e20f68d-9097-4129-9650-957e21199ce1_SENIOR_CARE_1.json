Ricky is kind, compassionate, strong, responsible, and my dad really enjoyed spending time with him. Ricky is professional and knows how to care for the elderly including taking care of personal hygiene, diet, administering medication, taking to doctor appointments and errands as necessary. He was also a wonderful companion for my dad. We always felt comfortable and reassured knowing Ricky was caring for my dad as he always went above and beyond to help my dad.
