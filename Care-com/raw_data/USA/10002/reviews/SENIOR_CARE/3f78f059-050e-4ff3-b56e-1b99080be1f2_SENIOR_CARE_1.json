I hired Winsome on 9/29/22 to take care of my mother in at home hospice care 24 hours around the clock.  From the first call we had together, I could see her kindness towards caring for others.  She met with me first in my mother's home to see how it was set up and then went to the hospital to meet my Mom so she saw what care she needed.  The care and love I saw her give to my Mom from day one was astounding!!  She treated her as if my Mom was her mother and never missed a day since she started working with her.    Mom passed away on 10/31/22 but Winsome, her daughter Keisha and I have become lifelong sisters.  They are exceptional caregivers with blessed hands. There is simply no one else I could have gotten better care from.  Hire her and know your loved one is in good hands.",
