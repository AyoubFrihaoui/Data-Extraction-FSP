We met with a few applicants and after speaking to Jeffrey in person we ran a comprehensive background check which put us at ease in hiring a stranger.  \r\n\r\nJeffrey provided great care and companionship for my father. Jeffrey is kind, thoughtful, and very detail oriented. We appreciated his flexibility with scheduling and we welcomed his helpful suggestions.  We look forward to working with Jeffrey again soon.",
