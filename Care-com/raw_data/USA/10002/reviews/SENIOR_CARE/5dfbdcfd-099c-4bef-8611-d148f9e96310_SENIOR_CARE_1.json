When she first started he was able to do just about everything for himself, and in the end he needed help with everything.  Justina was there for my father no matter what his needs were.  She was always professional and always kind and caring.  She made sure that whatever he wanted or needed was taken care of with his dignity in tact.  Even when he was too weak to get out of bed, if he wanted to, she made that happen.  His comfort and quality of life were always her priority.  Whether my family was there with my dad, or not, we knew that Justina was there taking wonderful care of him.  She went above and beyond her job description. We will forever be grateful to Justina!",
