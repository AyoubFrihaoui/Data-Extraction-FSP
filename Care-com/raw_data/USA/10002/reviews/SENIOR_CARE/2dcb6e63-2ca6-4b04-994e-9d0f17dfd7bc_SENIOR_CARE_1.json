For two years, she helped my mother regain her dignity by being there for her, when I unfortunately could not. She made sure she took her medications, Hygiene, made sure she took baths and cleaned up after herself. Help her pick out her outfits and make sure her face was made up so that it matches with her clothing. Took her out for walks and even attended some functions that made my mother happy. Catherina was with us until that unfortunate day when my mother passed.\nShe was highly recommended by a friend that also enjoyed her dedication to her profession.  She provided care for a post-op surgical patient that lasted a couple of months. I would recommend her service to anyone.",
