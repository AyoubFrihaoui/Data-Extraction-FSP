She provided live in care at the home of my sister and brother in law's where my father moved to when he needed full time care due to dimentia. We have had many caregivers over the years and no one ever came close to the level of care that Perlita provided. 5 stars for being a highly competent caregiver who cares with integrity and compassion. In addition to that, she made my father's declining  last years fun and light by being a positive, cheerful, fully present companion. She knew what he liked to listen to, what he liked to do, and who his friends were, so that she could keep his personality and character intact, when his dimentia took over. She knew how to read his moods and keep him engaged and entertained. Perlita also has an incredible work ethic and she knew exactly how to transport and move him with care, when he became nonambulatory. Our family is so grateful for Perlita's compassionate care of my father, honestly, it was a gift to have found her.",
