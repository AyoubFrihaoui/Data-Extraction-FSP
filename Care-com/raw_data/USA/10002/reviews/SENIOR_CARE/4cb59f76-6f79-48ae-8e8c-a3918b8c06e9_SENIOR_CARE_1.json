Not only did she care for my elderly mother with (constant) toilet trips, showers, and exercise (playing ball in the house and leg lifts), but Zhanna also went grocery shopping and cooked delicious meals (breakfast, lunch, AND dinner!). She did all of this with an incredibly upbeat attitude and warm countenance. \r\n        In addition, she even accompanied me and my wheelchair bound my mom on the train to our hometown to help situate my mom in her new assisted living facility. Zhanna had packed for trip, as shes the one who allowed for that trip to happen at all, and now my mom is happy at her new place, and so am I here, back in NYC, and so is my dog (who loves her, too!). \r\nForever indebted. Thank you, Zhanna!",

She began working for us 6 days before my mother died and she is so wonderful that we asked her to stay to care for  my 89-year-old father, who is in decent shape but needs support, housekeeping, and cooking. Since my bedridden mother with Alzheimer's is no longer in the picture that is why we don't have enough hours to offer for Zhanna   and are very happy to help her pick up another shift to fill out her week so she can stay with us, too! When my mother died, Zhanna knew exactly what to do.  I'm the overburdened daughter and she takes care of me, too   it is so lovely to have someone watching out for me now too. She finds things that need doing and does them. Before my mother died, we saw how caring and sweet Zhanna was with her.  By the way, she passed the highest level security check that Care.com offers.  You won't regret hiring Zhanna!",
