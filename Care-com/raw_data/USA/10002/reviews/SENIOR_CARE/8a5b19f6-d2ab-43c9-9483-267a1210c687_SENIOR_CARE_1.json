Jennifer has always struck the right balance between bringing her own experience and guidance to our children's care. We can't recommend her highly enough. She has been providing excellent, dependable care for our children & my elderly mother. She has become a part of our family. Jennifer does \"projects\" with our children each day, including crafts, cooking, and art. She prepares healthy snacks and is an organizing force in our hectic household. We would recommend Judy without reservation.",
