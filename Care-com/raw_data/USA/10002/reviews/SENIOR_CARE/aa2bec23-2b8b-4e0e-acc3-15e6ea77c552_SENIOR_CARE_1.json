She was supposed to start the very following day at noon.      Ms. Mercedes texts me at 10:25 a.m., the day she was supposed to start,  to tell me she's changed her mind because Sunday is her \"family day\".      She must have missed how I specified the shift in the ad and how I stressed how important it was for me to fill this weekend position during her interview.     Totally, totally not dependable, but a charmer when initially meeting her.",
