My surgery schedule changed several times, and I gave her the option to cancel, but she said committed and will not go against her word. So she adapted to the time changes without hesitation. \nPlus whilst I was in surgery, she picked up all of my prescriptions, and post surgery ensured I made it safely to my Uber, a few streets away from the hospital (and a great conversationalist during the ride) Once we arrived at my home, she helped me up two flights of stairs as well. Her kindness and care were so appreciated during a challenging time. Stephanie is truly a gem, and I'm forever grateful to her!  I canâ€™t thank her enough for the genuine care she provided. It was such a pleasure to work with her, and I highly recommend Stephanie to anyone in need of assistance. Stephanie is a gem, and I would gladly work with her again and again. Highly recommend!",
