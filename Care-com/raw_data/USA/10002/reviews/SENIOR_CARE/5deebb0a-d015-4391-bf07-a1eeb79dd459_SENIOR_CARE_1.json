I think of her as someone who maximizes life - meaning that she puts the effort in to get as much out of an experience as she can. She is also highly organized. \n\nOn a personal level, she has shown that she has both empathy and patience. She is good at putting others at ease and keeps the conversation upbeat. Therefore, I have no hesitation in recommending her for any role that involves the welfare of others in her care.",
