My mom was initially very against having a caregiver in her home, but Janis quickly won her over with her kindness and compassion. Janis is highly intelligent, and always was thinking ahead to make my mother comfortable. We never had to worry the entire time Janis was with our family, which was right up to the end of my mom’s life. Janis was a big part of our family, she made my mom’s final days much happier. We were thankful to have her.",
