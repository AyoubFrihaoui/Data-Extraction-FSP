One morning, after she came to work and get me set, I didn't hear her, so I called her, she came and told me she's fine, at that time she cleaned my entire apartment and that wasn't apart of her duty, it brought tears to my eyes, I couldn't thank her enough as my apartment was very dirty due to the fact that I was unable to clean it. I kept telling her thanks and offered to pay her and she resist it, she told me it's the least and she was happy to help, she also taught me that not everything you do in life, you should expect to be rewarded for, just put your heart in it and that's the best reward. She said as long as she can help, she will and I should not try to mess up her reputation by offering her money.",
