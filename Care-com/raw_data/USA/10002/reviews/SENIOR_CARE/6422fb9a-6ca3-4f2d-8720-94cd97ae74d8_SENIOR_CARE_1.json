This young lady cared for my 98 year old mother  who suffered from dementia full time for three years. Her presence changed my mother’s  gloomy sentiment towards life, and for that I will forever be grateful to Nene. If you are looking for a personable, attentive, punctual, patient, trustworthy and compassionate caregiver with high care standards then you’ll find that in Nene. She’s become extended family to us and whenever I have a friend in need of assistance she is the first person I contact because her work ethic is unparalleled and exceptional. She is a 10/10 and I highly recommend her. ",
