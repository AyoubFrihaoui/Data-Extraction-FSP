She has been my favorite Brooklyn caregiver for close to a year and I don't see that changing anytime soon. Jackie is funny and energetic, positive, and warm. She always makes me feel better when I am having a bad day and always finds some way to leave my home and my situation better than when she arrived. She is super flexible and has done everything from accompany me to the ER, to help with computer work, to test my apartment for mold. Highly, highly recommend her.",
