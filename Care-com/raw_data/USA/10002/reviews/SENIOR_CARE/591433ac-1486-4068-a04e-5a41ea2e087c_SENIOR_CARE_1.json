            "displayText": "Mara was fantastic! I came up to NYC from DC with my therapy dog, Macho. My dear elder friend who is bedridden in a nursing home really wanted to spend the day with Macho.  I found Mara through Care.com and she came to the job a few minutes early, easily grasped the situation at hand, immediately connected with my elder friend, and easily assumed the tasks involved.  Throughout the day she kept in touch with me by sending text messages and photos of my elder friend with my therapy dog, Macho; all had a wonderful day together!  Mara's companionship for my elder friend was so valuable--not only for making it possible to have a therapy dog experience, but for her ability to sit with my friend, engage my friend in ways which made my friend feel valuable and necessary.  They helped one another throughout the day together!  Mara also demonstrated a high level of responsibility on this first day by handling petty cash and errands--during the day she went out to market for my elder friend:)",
