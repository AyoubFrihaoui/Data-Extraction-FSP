He is compassionate, kind, loving, thoughtful and extremely capable of handling any situation that may arise. Joel is also very communicative not only with the patient, but with the extended family as well. Joel has a very calming personality, respectful of others and did treat my dad as if he was his own parent. There were times that we needed Joel outside of his normal work hours and he was always eager to respond and please. Even though my dad has passed we still keep in touch because he has become like a member of our family.",
