            "originalText": "I'm delighted to offer Valerie a review as she provided essential assistance during my recent medical emergency. She was prompt in her response and proved invaluable during my hospitalization. Given the hectic nature of the emergency room, Valerie adeptly advocated on my behalf to expedite my admission after spending an arduous 24 hours awaiting a room.\n\nHer expertise was evident as she facilitated the scheduling of my MRI amidst the hospital's bustling environment. Remarkably, she remained at my side for a staggering 36 consecutive hours, a comforting presence considering the absence of family nearby.\n\nValerie diligently monitored my progress, making frequent visits totaling several hours each time. She maintained open lines of communication with my family, keeping them informed about my condition and treatment, particularly crucial given the seriousness of my spinal cord involvement.\n\nHer familiarity with emergency and hospital protocols was evident as she efficiently organized my personal belongings, even returning to my apartment to retrieve essentials like my cell phone charger. During instances of prolonged waiting, Valerie demonstrated tact and diplomacy in engaging hospital staff, ensuring our concerns were addressed respectfully.\n\nUpon my discharge, she seamlessly guided me through the transition process and helped organize my living space, ensuring it was conducive to my recovery. From assisting with daily tasks like showering to providing guidance on safe practices post-hospitalization, Valerie's caring nature and resourcefulness were consistently evident.\n\nShe possesses a rare blend of confidence and sensitivity, tailoring her approach to meet individual needs effectively. Her commitment to ongoing education in the medical field was apparent, enabling her to communicate effectively with both families and physicians.\n\nValerie's dedication was truly exceptional, as evidenced by her willingness to rearrange her schedule and personal life to support me during this critical period. Without hesitation, I would highly recommend her services and gladly compensate her for the outstanding care and professionalism she demonstrated throughout.",
