Nicole instinctively knows when to step back and give the family time alone and when to engage. When she does engage, it is not just with the patient, but with the whole family-whoever needs her support, whether it's me, our 4yo, the dog, or my sick husband. Her communication style is developmentally appropriate, nurturing, and inquisitive-she is always trying to suss out everyone's needs and where she can be of use. Once she gets the groove of the house, she jumps in like double-Dutch, never needing to be told what to do. Her cooking is fabulous. Her heart is huge. Don't scroll past this magical lady.",
