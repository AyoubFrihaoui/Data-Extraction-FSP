            "displayText": "\nI am fortunate to have Maddy for almost 3 years now and my hope is that she will continue to keep me as part of her schedule. I emphasize on the word fortunate for when you can have a home health aide that you can completely trust, who is dependable, reliable, hard-working, caring, pleasant, etc., you are very fortunate for it is indeed difficult to find an aide possessing all these qualities. I am blind and like seniors and others with various disabilities,, I am vulnerable to be taken advantage of when an aide comes into my home. There is opportunity for the person to take money that may have been left on the dresser, read open mail that could have personal information, take jewelry, etc. I know too many stories of others who have had that happen which is a shame for the only thing a person wants is to have the help, have their home and everything they need in place so they can have the quality of life like everyone else. Maddy has done that for me in my home and when we shopped. She never let me purchase anything in terms of clothes that did not complement me and always help me look for the best sales.\n\nIt has been a blessing to have her as my aide and I feel and consider a friend. I highly recommend her for one with Shirley know they have the best of care being given. \n\nCarole C.   \n",
