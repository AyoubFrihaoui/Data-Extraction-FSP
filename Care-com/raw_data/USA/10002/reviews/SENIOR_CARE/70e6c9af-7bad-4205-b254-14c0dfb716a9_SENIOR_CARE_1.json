She was able to pick up on routines quickly, had no issues taking her to Physical Therapy appointments, was able to fill in when we were short staffed, she speaks up to voice concerns, and she is very attentive. The care with our loved one changes unexpectedly and no matter the changes Tea has adapted with ease. She is kind and caring and genuinely cares about the individuals she works with. She brings you peace of mind which is something you always want when you bring someone into your home.",
