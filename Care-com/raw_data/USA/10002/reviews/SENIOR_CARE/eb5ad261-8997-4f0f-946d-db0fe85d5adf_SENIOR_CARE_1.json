She helped me keep a clean house and has helped my dad move around the house with ease when he was finally home. She is very caring and responsible with all her duties. I could not wish for a better person to help out whether it was helping him move around or just keeping my house in order. I am so thankful for her and her work, and her partners too!  ",
