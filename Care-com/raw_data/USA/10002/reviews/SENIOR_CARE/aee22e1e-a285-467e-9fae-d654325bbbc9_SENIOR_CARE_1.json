My late dad had Alzheimerâ€™s and other conditions. He was a very difficult man due to his previous conditions of being independent most of his life. But Akwasi was able to work around him. There were times we needed him overnight and short hours but he always tried to squeeze us in. If I had the chance to hire Akwasi again I would highly do so due to his professionalism. He deserves more than a five star. ",
