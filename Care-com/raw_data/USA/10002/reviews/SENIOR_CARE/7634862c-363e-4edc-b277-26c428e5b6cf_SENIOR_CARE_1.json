Outside of the standard attributes you would expect from a good employee, she is just an exceptional person. Kind, prompt, solution- orientated, great communicator, Preemptive, considerate- and this is why I hired her for two different jobs for a duration of two years. If it was not an issue of finances, she would not be on the market right. Come to think of it, she has never been hired. When I checked her past employers/ references, they all either relocated (parents of children she cared for) or passed away (as per the family members of elder clients).",
