            "displayText": "I am glad to provide this letter of recommendation for Nana. My sister and I have employed Nana for over a year (since October 2012) to care for our elderly parents who live in Newton, New Jersey. She has been an excellent caretaker for them despite their many illnesses and physical limitations. My parents required constant attention as both had memory issues and can wander and fall. She always did a great job caring for them, keeping them safe and tending to their needs with a smile and encouragement. She dealt with medical emergencies with aplomb and always notified us promptly and kept us updated. \r\n\r\nNana is an excellent cook and she provided good meals for them. She was also patient with my mother as she guided my mothers' attempts to prepare items for breakfast or snacks. She dealt with my fathers' dementia and associated quirks very well.\r\n\r\nShe was very compassionate with them in their final days and they clearly appreciated that. She is very attentive to them and did all the tasks required to keep them healthy and clean. Nana takes charge and takes accountability for their happiness. She was very good at household chores, running errands and keeping things clean. \r\n\r\nWe all came to rely on Nana and she rewarded us throughout her tenure with us. We will miss her and are happy to recommend her to you!",
