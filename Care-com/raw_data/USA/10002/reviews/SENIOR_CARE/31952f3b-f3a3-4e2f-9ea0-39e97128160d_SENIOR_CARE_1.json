She was able to transfer my father to his wheelchair, bathe and dress him and help him with other adls. \nShe comforted my mother in her final weeks, helped manage her medicines, and held her hand and prayed with her when she was in need of spiritual support.  Sandra stayed with my parents overnight as well as during the day when needed.  Sandra truely was a blessing to our family and I am so grateful that we found her.  I highly recommend working with her.",
