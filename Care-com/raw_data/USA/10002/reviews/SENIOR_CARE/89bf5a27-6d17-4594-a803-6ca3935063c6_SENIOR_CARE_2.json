After a thorough interview on the phone, it was clear Yaa was the perfect candidate. She arrived at my Mom's house literally a few hours after the interview. Her energy was infectious right from the moment we greeted each other. She's very caring, charismatic, compassionate, and full of energy! She went over and beyond in making sure my Mom got every care she needed-going to the bathroom, checking on her while she slept, bringing her essentials like food and her meds, and much more! I highly recommend Yaa and will work with her again!",
