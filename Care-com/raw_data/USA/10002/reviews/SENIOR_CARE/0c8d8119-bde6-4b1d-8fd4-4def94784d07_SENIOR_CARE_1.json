It was very interesting for my daughter to spend time with Shorena as she was not only entertaining her, but also attempted to teach her simple verses and songs. When my daughter was with Shorena I knew my kid was safe. Her attitude towards her work was excellent. She was always well organized, reliable, honest and always asked me in case she needed advice concerning my daughter.\r\nIf you need any additional information, please, feel free to contact me.",
