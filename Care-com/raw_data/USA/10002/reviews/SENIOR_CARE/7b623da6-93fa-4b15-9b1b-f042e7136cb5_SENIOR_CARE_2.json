Stephanie truly cares for her patients and takes pride in her work. She cares for our father who is bedridden. He can barely move, doesn't speak and requires a feeding tube for all nutrients. Stephanie knows how to handle all his very difficult situations and does so with great ease. She is a wonderful person who is truly talented in her job. We consider her part of the family. I highly recommend Stephanie.",

She handled all of my father's needs flawlessly, with great care and professionalism. She handled difficult tasks with ease - some of which included eating, bathing, dressing, exercise, medicine and incontinence care. Most especially she became his most trusted companion. Her trustworthiness, dedication, passion and expertise were an immeasurable blessing to us. She was always available 24/7 to help accommodate my dad's needs as his dementia grew progressively worse and she was there for him right until his last breath.  I give Stephine my highest recommendation and I say with absolute conviction that any family in need of a caregiver for a loved one would be very fortunate and blessed to have her.",
