Needless to say, it was quite challenging physically, mentally & emotionally. Joey’s positive energy & nurturing nature really made a difference in my mother’s everyday moods especially when she was sundowning. We tried many caregivers, but they just were not able to create that connection with my mom the way Joey was able to. Just meet her & you will immediately understand what I’m talking about. Joey is so thoughtful & detailed, sweet & compassionate, with such a great personality. She has a fun spirit & awesome sense of humor too.  You know what they say, laughter is the best medicine! Well she made my mother literally LOL…all the time!! She also provided help & care with many different tasks such as taking mom to doctor appointments, grocery shopping, giving mom her meds daily, meal preparation, taking her out for walks & activities. She even helped with taking care of my mom’s dog as well which was a blessing because my mom’s dog provided her a lot of comfort & emotional support & Joey helping allowed my mom to keep her pet as the Alzheimer’s advanced & her memory declined. Just hire her, I promise you won’t be disappointed OR just simply meet with her & decide for yourself! You will have some peace of mind if you hire her, and we all need some respite care to allow ourselves to recharge. As the primary caregivers to family members we need to take care of ourselves as well with some downtime, Joey is your girl! She will take care of your family member like she’s your family member. ",
