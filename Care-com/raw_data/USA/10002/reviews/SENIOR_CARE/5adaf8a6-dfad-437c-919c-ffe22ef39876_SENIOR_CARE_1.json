She prepared meals, changed diapers and helped the twins with getting dressed and potty training. She juggled multiple tasks--such as making lunch or folding the children's laundry while also working on an art project with my daughter or playing LEGOs with my son. And she always followed specific care instructions (for example, screen restrictions, medicines that needed to be given, etc.). Beverly has a positive attitude and a loving heart, which makes her an excellent caregiver.",
