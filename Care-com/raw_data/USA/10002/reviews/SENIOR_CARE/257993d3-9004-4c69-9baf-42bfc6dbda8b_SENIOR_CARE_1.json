His devotion, compassion, initiative, communication, and care were extraordinary — to my uncle, my uncle’s large elderly dog, and our family, all of whom live far from the city. Without Michael, our family would never have been able to keep my uncle at home for as long as we did — and we will always be grateful. He has our highest recommendation.",
