            "originalText": "Amanda has been a home aid with my family for over 3 years.  I can't express how grateful we are to have found such a skilled, kind, confident, versatile,  intelligent woman to support us through such difficult times. our parents together 60 + years,  parents in 80's father with advanced cancer getting weaker & mother with declining dementia.  Amanda was so great at handling the various situations that came up and there were many. Always arriving with positive energy ready to do daily tasks, errands, cook and/or food prep, tidy up, physical support as needed, appointments or just get them out during daytime to enjoy life! She is also an excellent safe driver.  The situation only got more and more challenging as they were both declining and Amanda was with us sadly till my father passed away recently 11/25.  She still cares for my mother part time and we are so happy as having someone familiar and trusted especially for someone with dementia is priceless.   I would be more than happy to speak to anyone considering Amanda and answering any questions or sharing anymore. You would be so lucky to have her support.",
