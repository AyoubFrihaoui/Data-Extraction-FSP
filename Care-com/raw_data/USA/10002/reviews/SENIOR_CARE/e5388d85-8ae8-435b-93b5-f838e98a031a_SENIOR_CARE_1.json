            "originalText": "Kadiatou is one of the very best caregivers that my mother has had in nearly 8 years.  She is extremely reliable and is always on time.  Her manner is soft-spoken but confident, which works very well for my mother who has advanced dementia.  She has extensive experience and is excellent in the manner she takes care of my mother's hygiene, dressing, transferring, food preparation, and feeding.  All of these things would already distinguish her from most caregivers.  But, it is her sincerity, kindness, and patience that she shows to my mother that is most wonderful.  Kadia understands the importance of engaging my mother in conversation, giving her a reassuring pat on the arm, or holding her hand.  Kadia provides everything that is needed to give my mother the best quality of life.  My mother's eyes light up when she sees Kadia and she has a lovely connection with her.  I also deeply appreciate that Kadia is an excellent and courteous communicator with me.  On the rare occasion when she has had to change her schedule, she has told me far in advance.  And, if I'm out running errands, she stays in touch with me by text and phone to let me know how my mother is doing.  I feel very fortunate to have met Kadia, am very grateful for the care that she provides to my mother, and highly recommend her as a caregiver.  ",

            "originalText": "Kadiatou worked for my family from 2016 till 2023. I initially hired her to care for my 90 year old handicapped father who had been released from the hospital following heart surgery. Eventually, when he entered home hospice, she became his main aide. She was responsible for feeding him, cleaning him, wound care, and transferring him with the Hoyer Lift from his bed to his wheelchair. \nWhen she was not tending to my father, she was a companion for my mother, who suffered from confusion and memory loss. She was extremely responsible with money, keeping proper accounts and receipts, and she was never tardy or absent when needed. Perhaps what impressed me most about her was her polite, professional manner and her strength of character. She was highly intelligent and physically capable, both important features when dealing with people who have physical and mental handicaps. I can honestly say that she made my parents’ final days peaceful and comfortable. They were both extremely fond of her. Her help was invaluable, and I recommend her without hesitation. ",
