Of great importance, he needed his many medications monitored and administered properly and on time. Tornike took care of Sam with kindness and competence, an ideal combination. He kept the kitchen immaculate and took care of Sam's personal laundry.  His even disposition and winning personality were not only important for Sam, but for me, Sam's wife, during this difficult time.\n\nI give him my highest recommendation.\n",
