Her experience both at a professional daycare (Bright Horizons which is very rigorous in procedure) and as a nanny stood out; she was very knowledgeable about infant and child milestones.  She keenly observed the babies during the interview and would ask thoughtful questions about their development. \r\n\r\nWhile the nanny share did not work out because of logistical issues,  Nikia's references and her performance during the trial day were impeccable. Her references glowed about her motherly instincts and how babies love her. We found both to be very true. When my daughter started coughing in the middle of the day, Nikia ran a steam bath for her. She fixed our annoying blinds so that the baby could sleep. She was so proactive and so caring. I was heartened by how loving she was. Nikia is awesome!",
