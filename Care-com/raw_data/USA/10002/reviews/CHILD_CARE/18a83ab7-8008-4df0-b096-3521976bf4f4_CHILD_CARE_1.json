On the day she was fantastic, she helped get the kids wedding ready, took them to a diner, multi-tasked to say the least and really was the sweetest. Our girls loved her. We then asked Nadia back for another night during our stay and she was more than happy to, giving us updates regularly. She was fantastic and I would highly recommend. ",
