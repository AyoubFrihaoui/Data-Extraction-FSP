She is absolutely amazing  - full of energy, lots of fun, well disciplined, healthy habits and routines, listens and understands, and builds great character and morals with children.   Here is our perspective and experience: She is reliable - always good about schedules for duty, play dates, neighborhood -park playground - museum - library visits, feeding (pumped breast milk or formula), healthy meals, no junk food or candy, sleep, clothes, learning and social development, and flexible on notice.  She takes time to read, play, and listen to our children. She played nice quiet classical music and worked on their skills with games, toys, art, and books.  She found nearby play groups for making friends. Our kids always had a great time with her as babies, toddlers and kindergarteners.  She would work with our kids and come up with terrific stories, have a fun time and behave well.  Even though they are in elementary school now - they still look forward to her phone calls and visits.  She is an incredible Nanny and terrific care provider - we can always call, text or email her at a moment's notice and she will get back to us as schedules allow within a timely manner.  Sometimes it is tricky as parents to let go or listen to others, we were confident and are so grateful we had Ana.   Our kids completely adore her.  Ana is incredibly trustworthy - she will write down and tell you everything that happens during the day and gives great advise.  It is very comfortable to talk with her and get great feedback.   We were very happy with her and highly recommend her for Nanny services.  Her strengths: listening, artistic, gentle-disciplined care, clean, non-smoker, walks in the neighborhood or playground park, smart, reliable, awareness of needs, cheery and fun to be with, safe, organized, focused and forward thinking.  Her weaknesses: hmm, none really.   Have a nice week.  All the best,  Mimi & Dan",
