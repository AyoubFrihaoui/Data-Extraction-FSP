            "displayText": "Stephanie has been my friend for over 17 years and turned into family very fast. She is the most caring, kindhearted woman I have ever met. Steph is a people person and even more so a kids person. When I see her around children she is so comfortable taking care of them and playing with them. Steph works long hours in a daycare in north Jersey, which for some would be very tiring, but she enjoys every second of it. After work she will call me and tell me about all about the cute things the children did and even after put through a long ten hour day with infants she can keep going. She has the patience that anyone would strive for. Steph is an extremely trusting person and I will never hesitate to let her babysit when I have children. Steph comes from an excellent family surrounded by amazing friends, therefore she is very well-rounded. I highly recommend Steph for Care.com.",
