She plays with the child, makes sure they are fed, clean and comfortable. She is loving and nurturing. Anytime she comes to take care of our 10 months old, he smiles when he sees her. She makes sure the space is tidied up after her shift. We love Gabriella and we trust her with our baby 100%. We recommend her to our friends and they love her as well! Thank you for all you do! Life is so much easier knowing that your child is with someone you can trust and depend upon.",
