She was my little one’s first caretaker and it was an easy transition. Hannah never assumed doing things “her” way and always asked about my child’s preferences and personality. Aside from that, she’s a pleasure to have around—she’s creative and loves music and made sure that my little one was having fun. I’d absolutely hire Hannah again (she moved cities) and highly recommend her. ",
