Alyssa worked with us for 7 months and we were so sad to see her leave due to an opportunity she could not pass up! We are always excited to see Alyssa when she comes to visit. I would hire her again in a heartbeat and when she was local still called upon her for date night babysitting or if we needed help in a pinch. We consider Alyssa a part of our family and are so grateful for the time we got to spend with her and still miss her! ",
