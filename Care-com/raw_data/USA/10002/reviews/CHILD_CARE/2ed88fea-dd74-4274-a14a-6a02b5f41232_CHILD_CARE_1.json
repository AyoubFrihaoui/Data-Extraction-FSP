            "displayText": "Vanessa is an extremely responsible, terrific caretaker.  She worked for me for daily, for months, in a somewhat intense situation.  I have two boys with special needs, including the older one having ADHD, and she was great with them.  She was able to be authoritative when necessary but also playful and engaging.  Vanessa seems to understand and move among those attributes intuitively.  In fact I think she was even BETTER with my older one than with the younger one -- I think because her ability to work with the more immediate challenges was more engaging than my younger son's more sedate needs.  Additionally, she is absolutely responsible and trustworthy.  She was never late.  And I never once even considered the security of my things with her around.  You shouldn't pass her up.  If I needed someone again, I wouldn't.",
