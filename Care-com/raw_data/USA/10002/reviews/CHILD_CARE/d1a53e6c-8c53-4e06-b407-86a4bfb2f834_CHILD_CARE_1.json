She is kind, sweet and conscientious.  Isabelle also taught tennis this past summer at our club, and the kids adored her. Often times I would see her on the court looking like the Pied Piper with so many doe eyed kids flocking to her side. I would recommend Isabelle to any family and they should be so lucky to find her.",
