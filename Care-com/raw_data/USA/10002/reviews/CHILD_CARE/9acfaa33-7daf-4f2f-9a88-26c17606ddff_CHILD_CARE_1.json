She is not only punctual and reliable but also takes initiative in planning fun, age-appropriate activities that keep him engaged and entertained. Ebony is patient, kind, and always maintains a calm demeanor, even during challenging moments, which we truly appreciate. She communicates effectively with us, providing regular updates and discussing any concerns. It’s always a relief to find someone that is so understanding. All of these qualities let me know that my son was in good hands. \n\nI highly recommend Ebony to any family seeking a reliable and compassionate caregiver. We have been grateful for her presence in our lives, and I am sure she will be a great fit for any family fortunate enough to work with her. ",
