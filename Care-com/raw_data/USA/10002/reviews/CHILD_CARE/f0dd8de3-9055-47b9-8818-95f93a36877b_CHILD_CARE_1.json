She watched our kids for a date night and we had discussed other nights in the future in the beginning of our talks but hadn't set anything in stone. During her evening watching out kids, she was calm and collected (says a lot with 2 wild boys under the age of 4). After that night she reached back out to ask about a date that was mentioned previously because she wanted to plan some activities which we felt was so thoughtful. We appreciate working with Destinee and the boys rave about her.",
