            "displayText": "We hired Liza a few weeks ago to care for our daughter 1.5 days a week while I sleep between work shifts. Liza has a thorough resume of experience and is skilled with children. She is professional, punctual, organized, honest, kind and flexible. I can tell that Liza really takes the time to learn about our daughter and is attentive to her wants and needs. Our daughter has so much fun with her and I can rest peacefully knowing she is safe and cared for with Liza. Another thing I really appreciate about Liza is her willingness to be honest about challenges or difficulties she has with our daughter. I asked for this type of communication and she has kindly worked with us to ensure our daughter still receives the boundaries and guidance we desire while in her care. I highly recommend her for any of your childcare needs!",
