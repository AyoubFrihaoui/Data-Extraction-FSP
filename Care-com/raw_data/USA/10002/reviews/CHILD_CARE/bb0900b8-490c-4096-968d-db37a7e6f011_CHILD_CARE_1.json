First of all, she took care of our son like he was her own, thinking of activities for him, worrying about his health, and even following up to ask about how things went with our pediatrician.  Second of all, as we are first time parents, she told us about useful products and toys we could buy. For example, she anticipated ahead because our son was teething and suggested we buy bibs to keep his clothes dry.  Andrea was also extraordinarily helpful around the house. We asked her to do some light housework but, while the baby was sleeping, she managed to reorganize our kitchen, keep it spotless, clean the baby room and his toys and do the baby's laundry. I am experimenting with cloth diapers and she even washed the dirty cloth diapers! She is a self-starter, takes initiative and can add value beyond what is just asked.   I highly recommend her!!",

Andrea has been a perfect fit for every stage of my kid's lives so far. She's knowledgeable and loving with newborns, and playful yet firm with toddlers and preschoolers. She keeps the kids moving and engaged, and has instilled in them beautiful manners. She's made friends with many of the kid's classmate's caregivers and is always setting up play dates.  Andrea keeps our apartment tidy, handles the children's laundry and fixes them healthy lunches every day. And she does all this with hardly any guidance from me, which, as a mom, is a true luxury - not having to come up with a plan! Andrea's extensive experience and dedication to her work make her a true asset to a family!",
