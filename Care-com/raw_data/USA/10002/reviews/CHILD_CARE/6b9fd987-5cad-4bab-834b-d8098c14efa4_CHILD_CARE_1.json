She was amazing at helping both kids study for their tests, and even organized my middle school daughter with her test and project schedules.\r\nBoth my kids' grades and test taking skills improved during the time Allison was with us.\r\nAbove and beyond her responsibilities, she baked with my daughter, and even was a stand-in dance-mom when I was unable to attend one of my daughter's dance competitions.\r\nAllison is always on time, always cheerful and good-natured, and very reliable. \r\nI feel very confident in recommending her - any family would be lucky to have her!",
