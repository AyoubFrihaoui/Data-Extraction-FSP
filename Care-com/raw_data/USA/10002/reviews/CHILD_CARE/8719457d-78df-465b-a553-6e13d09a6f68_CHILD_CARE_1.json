My family recently moved to San Francisco. The move, job transition and routine shake-up was a lot for our family.  Kelly helped manage the chaos!  She has cared for my children exceptionally. She has been able to maintain a balance between the 2 and alleviate any stressful situations. (You know... 2 year old screaming at the top of her lungs...)  I highly recommend Kelly. Please feel free to contact me as a reference.",
