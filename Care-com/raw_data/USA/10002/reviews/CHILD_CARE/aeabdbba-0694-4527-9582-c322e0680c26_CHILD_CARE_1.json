Annie cared for the kids very well, made the kids happy and loved them very much. And they loved her back. They would color, paint Easter eggs, go to the park, read books, make costumes and plays, go to the library and have dance parties. Every school holiday they would make a bucket list of things to do and off they went having fun. That is a tradition Annie started and we've kept to this day.",
