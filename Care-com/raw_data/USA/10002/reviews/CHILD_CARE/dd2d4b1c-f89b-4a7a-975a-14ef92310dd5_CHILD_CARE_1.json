            "displayText": "Nicole responded to my nanny posting I posted when I was still expecting.  While I posted quite early, I thought Nicole would be a great match because she was living out of state at the time with plans to return to NJ around the time I would need her to start (which helped to alleviate my concerns that she might find another gig in the interim).  Plus, our meet and greet went very well and she had great references.  We entered into a contract and I gave her a $500 signing bonus that she would have to repay within 3 days if she terminated our arrangement prior to starting.  She ended up moving back to NJ shortly after signing our contract and while I worried she might find alternative arrangements, I was hopeful she would honor our contract or at least be transparent with me should she wish to terminate.  Our baby ended up arriving 2.5 weeks early and I texted her upon his arrival as we might need her to start earlier than anticipated. She responded that she had found temporary work and would not be available any earlier - fine, I can understand honoring her new commitment. But when I further tried to get a commitment re: her start date she got funny and sent me mixed messages, asking about the tax breakdown, which I had already defined quite clearly in the contract. It was clear she was having doubts, but she was beating around the bush.  I was very direct and asked her whether she found a better arrangement, requested that she tell me as soon as possible, at which time she finally admitted she had. She also acknowledged that she'd have to repay the $500 signing bonus, but asked for more time to repay it as she had already spent it. While I can understand finding a higher paying arrangement and wanting to terminate ours, the way Nicole handled this situation was so unprofessional and disappointing.  It's as if she accepted the position as a \"back-up plan\" to ensure she'd have at least one prospect upon her return to NJ.  Then, when she found a better deal, rather than be transparent with me (because she had already spent the signing bonus and didn't yet have the money to repay it), she let me think all was going to proceed as planned until I tried to pin down a committed start date with an amendment to the contract.  She wanted to string me along because she knew she couldn't repay the signing bonus just yet. She did repay the money after a couple of weeks, but the unprofessionalism she showed makes me grateful it worked out this way in the end.  I am now relieved not to leave my kids in the care of someone so shady and unprofessional.",
