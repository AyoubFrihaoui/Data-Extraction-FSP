We didn't know her beforehand, but she quickly put us at ease with her professionalism and warm demeanor. She was reliable, always on time, and showed great initiative, making smart decisions without needing detailed instructions. \n\nAlthough she didnâ€™t have many online reviews, she provided contact info for other families she had worked with, and everyone I spoke to was extremely happy with her. We couldn't have asked for a better babysitter and would highly recommend Kristen to anyone looking for a trustworthy and capable caregiver.",
