She’s been with us for the last four months and our daughter LOVES Lindsay — she is so excited to see her in the morning, she practically jumps out of my arms into Lindsay’s!\n\nLindsay takes the initiative to come up with sensory activities, music play, and art projects for them to do, and is great about taking our daughter out of the house to go to the park, the library, or just for a fun walk. \n\nLindsay is also excellent with her communication, updating us on what they’re doing and how our daughter is throughout the day with messages and adorable pictures. \n\nWe whole heartedly recommend Lindsay as a nanny or babysitter. My husband and I know that our daughter is happy, safe and engaged when she is with Lindsay, and we trust her completely. Any family would be so lucky to have her!",

            "originalText": "Hiring Lindsay was the best decision I have ever made. Last year at the end of the summer we decided we need someone part time to watch our 30 months old daughter because our schedules were getting a but busy. This September Lindsay has been with us for a year and became a very important puzzle in our family! She is very flexible and accommodating, at no point ever I was worried leaving her with my daughter. Her energy is refreshing and my daughter enjoys being silly with her. They do tons of crafting and activities and have so much fun. She is also very patient and knows well how to de escalate a situation or attend to tantrums. She was also doing an amazing job when my daughter was sick. Our daughter started 3k this fall so we no longer use Lindsay regularly but she is always available if we need her for example for drop offs or nights out. She is part of our family, a birthday party canno happen without her. We have nothing but good things to say about Lindsay, she would go above snd beyond for your child! ",
