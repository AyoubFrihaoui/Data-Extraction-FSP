She sat for us several times and our daughter loved spending time with her. When our daughter's daycare was closed during the covid lock-down, Jasmine was available almost every weekday to watch our daughter for the next 12 months. \r\n\r\nThe impact Jasmine had on our daughter during this period of early childhood development was very noticeable, and we felt blessed to have someone with such a positive attitude in our daughter's life. \r\n\r\nThe best part was how Jasmine interacted with our daughter helping to guide and teach her. We soon referred to her as the \"big sister\", and our daughter was excited to spend time with her everyday. Several times we took trips out of town and Jasmine came along to help out which made the trips very enjoyable for everyone.\r\n\r\nShe's cheerful, responsible, and dependable.Your lives and your child's life will be greatly enhanced with Jasmine around!",
