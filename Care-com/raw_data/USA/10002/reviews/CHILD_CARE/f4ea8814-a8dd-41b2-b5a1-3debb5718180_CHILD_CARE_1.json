Our apartment was a mess and we were overwhelmed. We found Keren on Care.com and she came over the next day and made everything better - organized, scrubbed, and made our home feel calm and wonderful. She often knows what we need before we do. I sometimes text her when I can't find something and she knows where it is. When we run out of a cleaning supply, she'll offer to pick it up for us. Also, Keren loves our kids and they love her. She often cares for them when we want a date night, and she checks in and play with them even when she's off the clock. I could go on, but the bottom line is that we trust and adore Keren - we are just so grateful for her.",

Keren always came to our home on time, cheerful and ready to engage the children with creative art and other enriching activities. She is a great listener. My children love Keren and look forward to spending time with her. She always followed our directions in regard to the children (bedtimes, food, activities). Many of my personal friends have hired Keren as a babysitter in their homes and they end up loving her. Keren can fulfill a variety of tasks and performed her duty well specially in taking care if my children. Not only as a babysitter but as a well organized housekeeper.
