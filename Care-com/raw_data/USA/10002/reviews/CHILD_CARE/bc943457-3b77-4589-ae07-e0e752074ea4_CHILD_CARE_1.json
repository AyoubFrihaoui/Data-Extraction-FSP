She is always punctual and incredibly dependable. It's so clear that she truly cares about my son and is always patient and positive in her interactions with him, even though he has a really hard time going down for naps and can be pretty moody. She takes him on daily walks around the neighborhood and to different parks to watch the big kids play. She's very creative and motivated: she is always singing songs, reading books, and playing on his activity mat with him. Also, she's a very hard worker and doesn't just want to sit around when my son takes naps. She helps me in ways I didn't know I needed: washing dishes/bottles, doing the laundry (including cloth diapers), sweeping, and meal prep. It's been a huge help for me as a full time working mom. Also, my husband works from home and it worked out really well; she was very conscientious of when he'd have conference calls to take my son in another room or out on a walk. Any family would be extremely lucky to have her.",
