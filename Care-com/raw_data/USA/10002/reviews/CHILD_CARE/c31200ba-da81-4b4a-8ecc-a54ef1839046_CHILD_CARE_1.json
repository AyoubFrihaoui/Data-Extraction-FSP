Whether it was an occasional night out or a week long vacation (with us or staying home with the children). She treated them as if they were her own and shared a special bond with each of them individually. She is active, funny, intelligent, creative, firm but fair, patient and respectful. She is flexible but can set and adhere to limits when necessary. She is very dependable and trustworthy. I had no concerns when she was in charge of the household while my husband and I were out of town. Her responsibilities have included: transportation to and from school and extracurricular activities, daily medicine dispersal, meals while at home and for school, caring for the 3 dogs and 1 cat, light housekeeping as needed, helping with homework and keeping the children safe and happy. While traveling with us, she keeps the children entertained by visiting various educational and fun places and helps with their care and safety.",
