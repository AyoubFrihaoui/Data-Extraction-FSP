She was gracious and understanding and easy to talk to about new ideas and approaches we wanted to implement. She is adaptable and incredibly loving. Your children would benefit greatly from her care, no matter the length of time! Our need has passed. I would encourage you to hire her before someone takes her off the market for good!",
