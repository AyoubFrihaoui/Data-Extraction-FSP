            "displayText": "We ADORE Hannah. I found her on Care.com and she was like a ray of happiness from the moment we met her. I remember the day like it was yesterday. She is firm yet fun, always happy and smiling. She is a bright, educated woman. My son is very strong willed and she has a way of working magic. My daughter loves doing art, singing and dancing with her. She worked with us as nanny for about a year and has stayed with us as a babysitter since my kids are now in school full-time. She is super flexible and will do anything asked of her. I would leave requests (fold kids' laundry, grab stuff at the grocery store, run kids to activities, etc). What was more important to us than having a cleaning lady or personal assistant was having someone that spent every moment with my kids stirring their imaginations on adventures and exploring. I can't say enough about the energy this woman has. She is a rare find. Hire her.",
