From the moment she joined us, she demonstrated a deep sense of responsibility, kindness, and professionalism. Valentina is not only highly skilled in childcare but also incredibly patient and nurturing, always ensuring a safe, engaging, and loving environment for our children.\nShe consistently goes above and beyond, whether it’s organizing educational activities, preparing nutritious meals, or fostering a positive and supportive atmosphere. Her ability to connect with children, while also maintaining structure and discipline, is truly admirable. Additionally, her reliability and trustworthiness have given us complete peace of mind, knowing that our children are in the best hands.\nValentina has become an invaluable part of our family, and we feel incredibly fortunate to have her. I wholeheartedly recommend her to anyone seeking a dedicated, compassionate, and highly professional nanny. Any family would be lucky to have her!",

Why she couldn't tell me the day or even hour before her interview baffles me. Still, I refrained from writing a review and asked if she would like to reschedule, she said she would like to, but she never followed up. She is either unreliable or needs to improve her communication skills. She does not seem to have respect for other people's times or schedules.",
