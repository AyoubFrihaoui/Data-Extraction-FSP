Spring of 2018 I embarked on a journey into the world of online babysitting for my child A. I employed in the course of about 4 weeks 3-5 different sitters for short visits with my child. Of these sitters, the only one that I truly enjoyed meeting with and talking to was Samia. Her relaxed but caring demeanor was important but also that she truly enjoyed hanging with my kiddo. As A. grew, so did our relationship! She has been the only constant sitter in A's life who is now 4.5 years old. We totally love her around so much that when she got a full time job we hired her sister. Any family would be lucky to have her as a babysitter. She is wonderful with children, attentive and I have zero concerns about her ever! Plus my daughters face lights up when she sees her :)",
