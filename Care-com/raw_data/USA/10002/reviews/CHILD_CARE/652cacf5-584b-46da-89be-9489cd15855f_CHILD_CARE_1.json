Just today with the snow we received, we asked her to come help us with outdoor activities with the kids.  We built a snowman with her and she was fantastic help with sledding!  She even saved my 3 year olds life when he almost ended up in the pond!  She dove after him and snatched him right before he hit the edge of the pond!  She herself wound up getting wet from the water but was fantastic with him!!  I wouldn't trust anyone else to watch my children! She feels like a part of the family and my kids love her.  You couldn't ask for anyone better!",
