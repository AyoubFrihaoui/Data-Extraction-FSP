She took care of our kids for two years starting when they were 3 years old and 1 years old. She handled them like a champ and didn't miss a beat! Most of all, she showed them love and respect. She drives, cooks, organizes - we call her Tayna Kondo! - does their laundry, does their dishes, takes them to fun activities, and develops them in an age appropriate manner. We always knew they are safe and well cared for. She also makes awesome and healthy meals and ordered groceries for the family (while thinking through all diet preferences and meal planning). We miss Tayna!",
