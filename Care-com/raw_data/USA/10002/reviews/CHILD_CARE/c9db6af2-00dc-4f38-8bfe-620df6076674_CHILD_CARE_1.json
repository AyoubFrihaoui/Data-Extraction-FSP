She was responsible for picking up our older son from school throughout the week and hanging out with him / helping with homework until one of us got home. She also frequently helped with dinner and bedtime when needed. She quickly became one of our five year old son's best friends and an important part of our childcare network. We have her to thank for our son FINALLY settling into being potty trained.\r\n\r\nMary Michael was reliable, punctual, patient, and generally just pretty cool. Even when she was tired she still showed up and did a great job. I would recommend her to anyone for anything!",
