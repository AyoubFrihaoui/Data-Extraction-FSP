She has been a great addition to our family and extremely helpful and flexible. She cares for our children as if they were her own and is very understanding of their needs and compassionate. She is very interactive with our children and keeps them active throughout day, by bringing them to the park, splash pad, and playing outside with them as much as possible. She is also very capable and dependable for doing school\ndrop off and pick up. Debbie has been a pleasure to have as our babysitter and we know our children are in good hands when she is with them. We would highly recommended her to other families. ",
