Jarelle picked up my boys from school and helped them get to/from after school activities, complete homework assignments, get dinner started and keep our apartment tidy. She is incredibly kind and supportive as well as flexible - she was always happy to stay a little late when work was keeping me at the office later than planned. A few times, she helped me out by watching our family dog for us while we were out of town.\r\n\r\nJarelle will help support your parenting preferences at home so long as you communicate them (no sweets before dinner, homework before playtime, etc etc). She is wonderful and you will not regret hiring Jarelle! I am a very happy referral for her. Should you like to speak further, Jarelle can pass along my contact information.",

As soon as we met her we knew immediately she would be perfect for our family. Jarelle is warm, caring, energetic, conscientious and mature. Our kids absolutely loved her and so did we. We trusted her entirely with our kids. Her responsibilities included picking our kids up from daycare and riding home with them on the subway, preparing meals, giving naps, bathing and putting the kids to bed. Jarelle always had a positive attitude and performed beyond our expectations. She worked for us for about a year until we moved out of the city- if we had stayed we'd absolutely have wanted Jarelle to continue working with us as long as she was able. I recommend Jarelle without any hesitation and would be happy to speak to anyone about our experience.",
