Tyzhae never gave me any trouble, she took my sisters to school & picked them up, my sisters would often tell me how much they enjoyed being around her because she made them smile, she always made sure they were fed & she was helpful when it came to homework or life advice. My siblings let me know Tyzhae was almost as much of an older sibling to them as I was. That means a lot to me because it shows Tyzhae is not only responsible, but that she also puts in effort even if she wasn’t asked to exert that effort. She’s shown me that no matter who she takes care of she is always going to give it her absolute best. ",
