She immediately took initiative to make a baby log and diligently tracked feeding, changing, etc. She is attentive to my daughter's growing needs and changing habits, and is amazing with caring for her and soothing her to sleep. She also took initiative to do dishes and light housecleaning in a thoughtful way that helped me out so much as a new mother off 2 trying to juggle a toddler and newborn on my own. I instantly felt comfortable with Jaclyn in our home. She is really good about communicating and talking through things. She is knowledgeable about childcare and someone who you can rely on to be a partner in caring for your children. I highly recommend her for newborns to children of all ages.",
