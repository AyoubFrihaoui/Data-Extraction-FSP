She cultivated a bond with the children, while at the same time was able to make them understand the need for good behavior, manners, and order in the house.  Maria did everything for us.  She ran all aspects of my household so that i could leave for work at 5am and return at 7pm.  Maria even stayed and took care of everybody and everything when I had to travel and be gone for 3-4 days at a time.  I trust Maria with the safety and well-being of my children.
