From the moment we met, her warmth and genuine care put me at ease, and her professionalism shone through as she meticulously asked about routines and preferences. Throughout the day, her attentiveness and nurturing nature were evident, providing a safe and stimulating environment for my child. The regular updates and photos she sent reassured me that my baby was happy and well cared for. Solimar is not just a babysitter but a dedicated caregiver who balances fun and learning beautifully. Her trustworthy nature and exceptional care allowed me to leave my child with confidence, making her highly recommendable to any parent.",
