She completed all tasks related to our daughter's care with no issue and, within a couple of days, made us feel as though she had been caring for our daughter for months.\r\n\r\nCecilia put a lot of effort in engaging with our daughter be it by reading to her until she was satisfied, playing with her in the park, or even taking the initiative to begin teaching her how to play chess.\r\n\r\nCecilia brought a youthful energy to her role, which along with her desire to outperform our expectations, was quite refreshing.\r\n\r\nWe would recommend Cecilia to anyone looking for childcare without reservation.",
