She cared for our daughter for almost 2 years until our daughter started going to daycare, and she still occasionally does babysit for us. Our daughter is extremely fond of her and does still remember her, which speaks to the love, closeness, and secured she felt around Simona. As parents, we were at ease knowing our daughter is with someone, who genuinely loves and cares for her, and is a completely reliable person. ",
