She will play and care for your baby, read to them books, take them out, organize play dates, pay attention to their development needs, and work with you to discuss what you should be thinking about next. She is experienced with babies and has the confidence to navigate the fun and the challenging days. She was happy to come in early or stay late when asked. Despite this being a short term appointment, she looked after our son with a lot of care and attention and they have become very close. I spend the afternoons listening to them giggle whilst they play. As a first time mom, I never worry when I leave the house as I know that my baby is in great hands! If our circumstances were different i would 100% work with Paula full time. Any family who gets to work with her will be very lucky! \r\n\r\n\r\nWe are also working remotely and it has been very nice to have her in the apartment, spend time together and learn from her. \r\n\r\nHighly recommend and would work with Paula again and again!",
