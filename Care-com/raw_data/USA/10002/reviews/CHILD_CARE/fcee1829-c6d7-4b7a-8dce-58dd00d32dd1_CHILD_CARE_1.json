            "displayText": "The woman we know as Auntie Florence became part of our family starting soon after we brought our son G home after his birth.  She is one of the most energetic and hard-working people we've ever met.  While so many people these days are distracted by their cell phones, Auntie Flo has had a laser focus on G and his development and education.  She reads to him every day, plays with him, engages with him, keeping an eagle-eye on him.  G turns two next month and his vocabulary and extroverted demeanor are due in no small measure to Auntie Flo's dedication and love.  I only half joke that, if G gets married, the first invitation he sends should be to Auntie Flo since, in no small measure, she will have helped shape the person he is to become. G is starting daycare in the fall because we think he needs to socialize with his peers and we can't afford a full-time nanny given our new situation.  Highly recommend!",
