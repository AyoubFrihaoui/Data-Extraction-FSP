Mackenzie is kind and caring, responsible, reliable, punctual…. From the kids‘s point of view, she is fun and creative up for anything and very present and engaged. My kids love when she comes. It makes it so much easier to be away from your kids when you know that they are not only safe and cared for, but are also having fun.",
