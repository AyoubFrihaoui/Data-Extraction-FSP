The first day she asked if I could pick her up at the subway and because it was raining I said yes, but thought it was a weird request.  The second time, she asked if I could pick her up at her home because she sprained her ankle. I explained it is her responsibility to get to and from my home. I was paying her $40 an hour. She didn't show up and texted me that should would tutor my daughter virtually, this was 10 minutes after she was already supposed to be there.  I told her I would find someone who was reliable.  Do not hire her, she immediately tries to take advantage of the situation and is not a responsible person.  ",
