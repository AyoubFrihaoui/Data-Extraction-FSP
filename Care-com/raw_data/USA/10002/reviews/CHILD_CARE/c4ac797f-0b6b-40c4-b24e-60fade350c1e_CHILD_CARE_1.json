She took care of my 1 year old boy, and her responsibilities included: cooking him healthy food, doing his laundry and light housekeeping. As a caregiver she was loving, responsible, punctual, and very patient.\r\n\r\nOur boy was always happy and in a great mood!\r\n\r\n She engaged him in different development games, constantly talked/sang to him, took him for walks in the park and overall helped him explore and learn new things each day. We were happy with her service, but my in-laws moved in and no longer needed help. \r\n\r\nI recommend Natalia to work as a babysitter and I am sure she will do a great job.",
