She is punctual and responsible and cares a great deal for kids. She comforted our little guy when he was trying to get to sleep at night enjoyed taking him to the park during the day. She gave baths and dinner and followed our bedtime routine as we’d requested. She is a lovely person and we will absolutely hire her again, as well as recommend her to other families.  ",
