She often notices when a child needs that extra attention or care, because they're going through something in the moment.  She has a fantastic, sunny disposition as well.   I have worked with Sophia for over a decade in the school system.  I would highly recommend her for any child care position.",

After some time, I hired her to stay with B on date nights and even when I traveled for work. She is reliable, caring and most importantly trust worthy. Your child could not be in better hands.
