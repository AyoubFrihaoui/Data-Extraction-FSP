            "originalText": "Really negative experience hiring Ruthi. As a new, first-time mother of twins, Ruthi told me I was \"anxious\" and \"overly-sensitive\" after she fed my preemie daughter formula that I had never instructed her to do/okay-ed. When my girls were 1 mo old, I was still exclusively feeding my twin daughters breastt milk. One Sat while I was at a restaurant a couple blocks from the home, Ruthi needed more milk to give to one of the girls. Rather than call/text/message, she decided to make formula and feed my daughter without asking/informing me. When I tried to explain to Ruthi that I was upset about the fact that she didn't call me to ask, she tried to explain that the formula was okay and that I was being unreasonable. Ruthi is for a family who is okay with someone telling them how to raise their children. She is not shy with complaining, telling you how you should do things, and providing some extremely outdated child rearing advice. She pushed sugar-water as a remedy, told me my daughters were dehydrated bc they had loose stools (duh they only drink milk), over dressed my babies to point that they were overheating under layers and layers of clothing, and was the nanny equivalent of man-splainer. Absolutely would not recommend.",
