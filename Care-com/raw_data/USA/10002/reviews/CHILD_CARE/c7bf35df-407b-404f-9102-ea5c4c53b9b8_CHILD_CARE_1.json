            "originalText": "We have had the pleasure of having Esosa tutor our son, who is enrolled in a gifted and talented kindergarten program. Initially, he was struggling, feeling discouraged, and falling behind despite his bright nature. This is where Esosa's remarkable skills came into play.From the onset of her sessions, we noticed a significant and almost immediate improvement in our son's academic performance. Remarkably, within just two weeks of working with Esosa, he began reading confidently. More than just academic progress, Esosa has been instrumental in boosting his self-confidence, encouraging him to embrace and enjoy learning. Her approach is not merely about teaching; it's about instilling a love for learning and making it an enjoyable experience.Esosa's ability to motivate and connect with children is exceptional. She has a unique talent for engaging young minds in a way that is both educational and fun. This connection wasn't just limited to our son; as parents, we too found ourselves drawn to her teaching style. She provides us with weekly assessments, keeping us informed of our son's progress, and equips us with tools and strategies to support his learning journey at home.Her commitment and talent in working with children are evident in every session. While part of me wishes to keep such an incredible tutor our little secret, it's only fair that the world knows about Esosa's exceptional abilities with children.",
