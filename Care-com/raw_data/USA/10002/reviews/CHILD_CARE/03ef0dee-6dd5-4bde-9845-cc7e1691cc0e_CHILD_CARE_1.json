While she did a fine job, out of the blue, she told us she needed to stop working with us because she didn't have enough time to spend on her schoolwork. We asked her to work one final week for us, which she agreed to do. Then, two days before her second to last shift, she showed up at our house unexpectedly to return our keys and said she wasn't going to be able to work for us that last week, leaving us totally in the lurch for childcare and without any explanation. We were completely flabbergasted at her lack of responsibility, and it really called into question her judgement, as well. This was after we let her take a week off of work (with one day that we paid), and then another day off, both with very little notice, in the span of her first two months. I cannot recommend her, and I'm sorry that we hired her.",
