M. lived with Alzheimer's disease--at first, she was able to live in her apartment by herself, then she transitioned to an assisted living facility. Sindy was with us for the entire journey. M. always saw Sindy as a friend, and vice versa--this was a rare and unusual gift in the world of senior care, and we are certain that Sindy's care made a difference in M.'s health and quality of life. Since M.'s passing, Sindy has also babysat for our 2 small daughters, both under the age of 3, showing the same level of sensitivity and care. We originally found Sindy on care.com, and are happy we did!",
