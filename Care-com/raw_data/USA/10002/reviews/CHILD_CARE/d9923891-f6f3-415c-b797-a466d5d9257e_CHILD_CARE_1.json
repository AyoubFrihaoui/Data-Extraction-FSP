            "displayText": "Megan watched our 6/7 year old and 4/5 year for 10 months during Covid. She helped around the house and was able to flex and work around the chaotic environment in our home. I was working from home and supporting a 1st grader with online learning. Megan took on helping the preschooler with remote preschool. Megan could shift and shuffle to keep the 1st grader busy and fed between school calls and self-lead learning AND keep the preschooler away from me while I worked and away from the first grader and I while we did the remote 1st grade. She helped support the pets (dogs, cats, guinea pigs, and rabbit) in the home as well. Also, she helped with some home-improvement work while the kids and I were out of town for a few weeks. Would recommend Megan for any family looking for date-night and/or more regular care!",
