She has taken care of my 2 boys (ages 8 and 4) with ease.  I interviewed several nannies, but chose Kendra due to her calm and professional demeanor, and many years of childcare experience. I know my boys are always safe and happy with Kendra.  She is fun and silly with them, but knows how to keep them in line when necessary.  Kendra handled school pick-ups and drop-offs, after school activities, playdates, feeding, bath time and light housekeeping.  Kendra is also great with babies.  She started with us when my youngest was 6 month old.  Please do not hesitate to reach out for further information.",
