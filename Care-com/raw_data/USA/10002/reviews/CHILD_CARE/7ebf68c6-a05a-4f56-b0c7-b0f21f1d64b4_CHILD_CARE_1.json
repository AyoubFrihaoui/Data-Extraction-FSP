When working with Lexi at a local rec camp she was punctual, allowed for the kids to have an amazing time due to her energy, and caring as well. I know that Lexi is committed to whatever she agrees too and is very very very reliable! Lexi is very inventive as well and can always brighten up a room! Her energy is amazing for those active kids, but also is calming for reserved kids! Overall if you hire Lexi you will not regret it!",
