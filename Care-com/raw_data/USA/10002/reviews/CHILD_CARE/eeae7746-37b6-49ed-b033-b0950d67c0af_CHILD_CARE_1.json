            "originalText": "In short, Diana is incredible. She worked for our family for 1.5 years as a full time caregiver for our daughter and one other child. She is kind, engaged, playful and in tune with each of their needs. She reads to them constantly, takes them to music class, readings at the library and to the playground. When they are not sleeping or eating they are out on the go! Our kiddos are so excited to see her every day and sad when she leaves.\n\nShe is always on the floor with the kids engaging them. When they were younger, she was helpful in getting them on a sleep schedule and gave us detailed feedback when asked. She has fully respected our no screen time rule while remaining available throughout the day when we had a question or concern. She has a playlist of songs and does morning music time with the kids first thing, dancing and singing with them. She is gentle with them, encouraging them to try things first themselves, when appropriate, before jumping in to help. She encourages their independence by asking them to help her pack the snacks, get the stroller ready, pick out their shoes or jackets etc. When I am working from home, I hear them laughing all together any time they are in the apartment. She is also wonderful with mealtimes, including suggestions for possible foods for them to try. I could go on and on. We only said goodbye as our daughter started school but I would hire Diana again any day!! Any family would be lucky to have her as a fellow caregiver. ",
