She quickly hit it off with my shy child, engages in play, leads activities, and manages conflict with the kids in a way that is supportive of their wants but assertive in her position of being in charge. She is prompt, dependable, and communicative. She asks questions and gives updates. She engages the kids to help clean up, and spaces were always tidy when she was done. I would definitely hire her again.",
