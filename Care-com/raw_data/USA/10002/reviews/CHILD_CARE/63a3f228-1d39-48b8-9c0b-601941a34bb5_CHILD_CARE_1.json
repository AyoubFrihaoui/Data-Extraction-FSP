            "displayText": "We had the pleasure of having Mariana look after our little one for the past 5 months. She was our full-time nanny for our now 8-month old daughter, and only recently stopped working for us because our daughter was ready to start daycare. She began working with us when I was heading back to work, and helped make the transition easier by giving us frequent updates on how the baby was doing, and by exhibiting her genuine care for our daughter. Mariana is incredibly kind, gentle, and caring, and was amazing with our daughter. She was attentive, read to the baby regularly, took her for daily walks, and we always knew that our daughter was in good hands. Our daughter definitely loved her time with Mariana, as she always had the biggest smile on her face when she saw her each morning. Mariana was also always willing to accommodate our hectic schedules, and come in early or stay late when we needed her to. We truly feel that she will be a great help to any family, and highly recommend her.",

Unfortunately, Mariana had to leave us due to personal problems.\r\n\r\nMariana is a very caring and nurturing person. She always put our kids first and was very attentive to their needs. She knows what kids need at every stage and will go the extra mile to provide it for them. She likes to read for them, play with them and take them out for walks, and will never neglect them or leave them unattended.\r\n\r\nMariana is very good at multitasking. In addition to caring for our children, Mariana has been very good at keeping our house clean and tidy and helping with any tasks that may present themselves. When we needed her to come a little earlier or stay a little late, she was always happy to accommodate us.\r\n\r\nI warmly support Mariana in her future endeavors and I am certain she'll be a valuable addition to any family in need.",
