            "displayText": "Sarah cared for my son for 3 days while I was on a business trip in the area. She was punctual and friendly. I was in a hotel, which is hard for child care, and Sarah rose to the occasion. The issue was pricing. We spoke 3 days before my trip and agreed to an hourly rate. We texted a bit after that, and all seemed fine. When she arrived, Sarah explained that the going rate for sitters was $4 more than what we agreed to  and that was what she was now charging. I said I felt that wasn't fair, and she then lowered the new rate by $2. That night, she texted thanking me for my understanding in increasing the rate by $4 per hour. I reminded her that she had agreed to a lower number, and that's how it ended up. Sarah and I had originally settled on one rate and I felt uncomfortable when she increased the price while already on the job. Then, to try to increase it again seemed like a bit much. She has some great qualities, but I'd recommend putting everything in writing when hiring her.",
