From the moment she began caring for our then-5-month-old, it was clear that she was the right fit - she brought so much love, energy, and humor to work every day (and a huge smile). Sophie felt more like a trusted friend than a hired caregiver, but she was still incredibly professional and I could quickly and easily offer feedback on minor adjustments or preferences as she continued to learn/grow. Grateful to have crossed paths with Sophie. (Side note - she's an unbelievably talented singer!)",
