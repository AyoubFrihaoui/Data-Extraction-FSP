Heath is so warm and fun you can't help but absolutely love her. She is able to gently set boundaries when necessary. Heath has demonstrated good judgment in hard situations and I always felt confident that my children were safe and well cared for. Heath is a true professional. She reliably shows up for shifts on time and her work. Her prior work experience and education in child development is a major bonus! When she moves back to my area she will immediately have a job back with us! ",
