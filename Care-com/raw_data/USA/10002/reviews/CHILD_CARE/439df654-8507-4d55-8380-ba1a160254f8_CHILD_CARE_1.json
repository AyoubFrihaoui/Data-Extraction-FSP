Our needs have changed with the arrival of our second child and we will be very sad to see her go. She is caring, conscientious, creative and very reliable. My son absolutely loves her and she is always coming up for fun activities for the two of them. She is never on her phone and she is always very engaged with him. An amazing cook, excellent artist, and incredibly organized partner in caring for our son, our loss is truly your gain. ",
