She gave him snacks, took him outside, changed him, read lots of books with him, and helped out with our small dog as well. She showed up promptly each day, and tidied up at the end of the day. When she watched our son it was quite hot outside, and she was very conscientious of making sure he stayed cool, taking him outside to play at the water table and always changing him into dry clothes afterwards. We strongly recommend Madeleine for your childcare needs! ",
