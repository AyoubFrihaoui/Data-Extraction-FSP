She was so calm and excited to be caring for two infants at once, no easy task. My baby girl was even sick on the trip (we didn’t realize she had an ear infection until we got home) and Andrea was nothing but loving and patient with her despite being fussier and clingier than normal. Andrea taught me tricks to get her to take a bottle, worked with me on our schedule and loved on my baby through contact naps when she had trouble sleeping (all things that had us stumped since we didn’t realize she was sick). Andrea was professional and our first caretaker outside of family. She truly loves being with babies and I was instantly at ease with leaving my baby in her care while we skied. I am most impressed at how she adapts and perceives challenging situations as a puzzle to figure out. She truly takes the time to get to know both you and your baby to provide personalized care. She is such a light and we were so lucky to have her! Can’t recommend her enough! ",

            "originalText": "I had the pleasure of hiring Andrea for our 4-week old son for 2 weeks as a night nurse and then as a 24-hr nanny during an international trip for my sister's wedding in France. She was an outstanding caregiver to our newborn, demonstrating remarkable kindness and patience. Her fluency in French made navigating the area effortless and reinforced our confidence she could handle any situation. Her independent and proactive nature ensured that our baby was well-taken care of, allowing us to fully enjoy the wedding festivities without worry. She is the ultimate professional, taking the time to understand our desires and asking for feedback. We had a rigorous sleep training schedule in mind, which she fully embraced and followed while providing us with frequent updates.\nI highly recommend her services to anyone in need of a capable and caring nanny for their travels or night nurse needs. She made our trip truly memorable and stress-free!",
