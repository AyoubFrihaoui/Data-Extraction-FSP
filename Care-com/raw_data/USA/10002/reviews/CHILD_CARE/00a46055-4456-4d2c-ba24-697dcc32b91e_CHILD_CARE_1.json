They worked with us several times a week for two months until the school year began and it was a great experience for our family. Both my baby and my 3-year-old loved Caro's energy, playfulness, and kindness. They were extremely conscientious and communicative, and we always felt comfortable knowing Caro could handle any challenge that came up and keep us fully informed if needed. (Especially during some of my toddler's most temperamental spells!) We highly recommend them as a trusted caregiver for your little ones.",

She's amazing at coming up with fun activities outside and inside, though she has a special love of nature. My kids can be a little competitive, especially with a favorites babysitter, and Caro does a marvelous job of making them both feel special.
