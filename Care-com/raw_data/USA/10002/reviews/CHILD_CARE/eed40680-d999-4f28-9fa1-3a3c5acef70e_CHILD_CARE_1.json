I was petrified of the thought of hiring a stranger to watch our 8 month old but Jasmine was amazing. She is in college and she came highly recommended by several professors who she babysits for on a regular basis. Her grandmother accompanied her on the interview to make sure we weren't weirdos (this actually made me feel better to know that she came from a loving caring family). The baby loved her! She sent me texts updates throughout the night so I didn't have to worry. Every time we put the baby in the pack and play to sleep, she would scream bloody murder but when Jasmine put her to sleep, she went to sleep without a peep! We call her the baby whisperer! She is great! Hire her!",
