We were so fortunate to have had Jayel with us for the past year and a half.  My daughter has benefited enormously from the constant one on one interaction, book reading, visits to the park and playground that Jayel has provided for her.  Jayel is caring, considerate, understanding, empathetic and highly intelligent.  I would be happy to have a call with any prospective families to discuss our wonderful experience having Jayel as our nanny. ",
