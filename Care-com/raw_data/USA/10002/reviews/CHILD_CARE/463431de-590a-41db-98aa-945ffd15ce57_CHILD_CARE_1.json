Her duties included the cleaning of his bottles and plates, etc., changing his diapers, feeding and preparing his meals and snacks, and keeping his play area clean. From time to time she has even helped me with his laundry because let's face it sometimes we all get too busy. She also played a great role in helping me get my son off of the bottle (he is almost 2) She always has new things to do with him, such as Spanish classes at the library, taking him to his classes or the play space, the park, making play dough and because of her, he has more play dates and some new friends. She is reliable and will always come early and stay late if I need her to even if there is some place she needs to be. It is unfortunate for me that I cannot use her full time right now because we are about to give birth to our second child and now is when I will need the help the most, but I highly recommend her. Any family would be lucky to have Andrea taking care of their children. I know that mine is.",

From time to time she has even helped me with his laundry because let's face it sometimes we all get too busy. She also played a great role in helping me get my son off of the bottle (he is almost 2) She always has new things to do with him, such as Spanish classes at the library, taking him to his classes or the play space, the park, making play dough and because of her, he has more play dates and some new friends. She is reliable and will always come early and stay late if I need her to even if there is some place she needs to be. It is unfortunate for me that I cannot use her full time right now because we are about to give birth to our second child and now is when I will need the help the most, but I highly recommend her. Any family would be lucky to have Andrea taking care of their children. I know that mine is.",
