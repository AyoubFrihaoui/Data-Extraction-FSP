She is wonderful and hard working, honest and sweet. So deeply caring. So flexible and understanding. Her responsibility grew over the years - she knew the rhythm of our house. She was part of the family. She was incredibly reliable, Always giving lots of advance notice before time off.  She was very careful and cleanly before Covid and obviously with Covid, incredibly careful. She rarely got the common illnesses over the course of the years. We all miss Elanor and wish her all the best.",

My daughter was an incredibly difficult infant with acid reflux and a strong resistance to taking a bottle. Elanor managed to be the only person able to successfully get my daughter to take a bottle multiples times per day while I was at work. In addition my daughter was very difficult to get to nap but Elanor was truly the baby whisperer and somehow got her down successfully every day. Now at nearly two years old my daughter is speaking in full sentences and is ahead of her peers after spending so much time with her. She even manages to get my toddler to eat vegetables daily. Her patience is something I wish I possessed myself.\r\n\r\nShe is punctual, reliable and flexible when we need her to come early or stay late.\r\n\r\nIt saddens us greatly to be losing her everyday and if I were not staying home after #2 is born, she would definitely be staying with us.",
