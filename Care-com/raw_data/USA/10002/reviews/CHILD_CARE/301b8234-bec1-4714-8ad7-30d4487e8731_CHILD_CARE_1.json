She plays with her, does her hair and loves to help her learn new things. I work long hours quite often and my home is always clean and organized and my daughter is fed and ready for bed. Sometimes, when I'm late, she'll even read her a bedtime story and put her to bed. She's always pleasant and eager to help. We love having her with us.",
