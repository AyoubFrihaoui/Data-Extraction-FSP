We were extremely comfortable w/ Hayley from the very beginning & could tell how amazing she was in her natural ability to really care about getting to know our daughter; her likes & dislikes & really took the time to play & engage with her. Everyday our daughter was excited to see her & bonded immediately. We always felt she was safe & well taken care of; never had to worry. Aside from being prompt & efficient, Hayley was always focused on our daughter & took a strong interest in her well-being & was always clear in her communications with us. Additionally, Hayley is an all-around warm, caring, dedicated, positive & energetic person. She is incredibly responsible & dependable; a great caregiver who uses understanding & patience when interacting with our daughter. We consider Hayley part of our family & are so lucky to have her help & support; any family would be very fortunate too",
