She was  terrific! Our boy loved her and was excited each morning she came. She is very hands on. She was down at his level, playing with his puzzles, drawing and coloring, playing with his toys. She would take him outside for walks and go to a small playground near our home. She would read and sing. She is an asset to any family who is lucky enough to find her to care for their children. We were sad when our time together ended. We plan to use her for date nights and occasional babysitting because she is so wonderful. And if I ever needed care for my kids again, she would be the first person I would call.",
