She was very punctual, flexible, dependable, caring, loving & brought a positive energy to work daily.  Over the course of the year, our daughter thrived under Xenia's care. Xenia is a great teacher, caretaker and has a good understanding of childhood development. She takes initiative and is able to come up with toddler friendly fun activities indoors & outdoors. Additionally, due to her background in childhood dev. she was able to create lesson plans appropriate for my daughter's age. She has made learning fun for my daughter and my daughter's language/vocabulary have soared. Xenia also worked with us during the COVID pandemic and was excellent at following CDC guidelines regarding necessary precautions. She made us feel at ease when she took care of our daughter.  She is wonderful and we will miss her.",

As she started with us when the girls were about 16 months, she is great with babies, toddlers and even older kids too, as she has watched my 9 year old son on many occasions. Since she started with us she has been able to manage the twins on her own, allowing me to be able to run errands or spend time with my older son. She loves being active with my girls and keeps them busy taking them to the park and scooting, going outside for walks and to our playroom when the weather isn't nice. She is super reliable, prompt and takes initiative in teaching the girls. I don't know what I would do without her during these very active toddler years with twins.  ",
