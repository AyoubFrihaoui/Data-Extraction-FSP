            "originalText": "Amanda has cared for our two children for the last two years with attention, skillfulness and dedication. She is particularly skilled at helping teach emotion regulation to young children and has a comprehensive understanding of sensory issues. She is unfazed by the challenges that young children can sometimes pose and handles difficult moments with consistency and clear direction. Our children adore her and she has remained an important presence in their lives even as they have come to depend on her less as they have grown. She plans ahead and always has rewarding projects and experiences for our kids. She picks them up from school, schleps them wherever they need to be, does their baths and nighttime routine, including weekly date nights. She handles all of this independently, without need for our intervention or assistance. She will be an invaluable asset to your family as you navigate the complexities and joys of childhood.",
