My then baby girl was in love with her and made my transition back to work effortless! After 2 years with her, she quickly became family and helped my husband and I in welcoming our baby boy! She somehow managed to care for my infant and toddler and never once showed any sign of distress. Her rates are very fair even though at the time I wished I could pay her more considering all the hard work, commitment and loyalty she put into my family. Unfortunately, ever since we moved to the U.K. it's been incredibly hard to find someone nearly as close to her. Cheers Maria! Hugs and kisses from London!",
