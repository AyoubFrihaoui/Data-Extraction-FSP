Our boys were 4 and 9yo at the time and they loved her! Janice helped them manage remote school and planned plenty of fun activities to keep them occupied. She was punctual, professional, patient and kind. We continued to hire her for occasional babysitting once the children returned to school. We highly recommend Janice to work with children of any age. ",

She always arrived on time and was firm, consistent, kind  and calm with our 3-year-old daughter. She didn't let her run wild and had great techniques for teaching/disciplining her. For instance, she didn't want to eat her peas so Janice said she could have a sip of juice for each bite of peas she ate. It was simple - albeit tedious - but very effective. She took her out everyday to the park or beach and seemed to really enjoy playing with her. My husband and I were very impressed with Janice, and we will definitely call her again in the future.",
