            "originalText": "Deja was an extremely attentive, patient and caring babysitter for my one-year-old. She was dependable and was always early or on time on our scheduled days. She engaged my child in different activities like music, dancing and art, which he absolutely loved. One day, Deja brought over a \"no-mess\" water painting toy that my child loved so much that I bought him one of his own! Deja took him on many walks and had outside play with no injuries. My child is also picky with food but she was patient with introducing new foods to him and reporting back how he responded every day. She let me know upfront that she had a back injury but was able to do all of this with a wonderful positive attitude. Now that my child has started daycare, I no longer need a part-time babysitter but I highly recommend her!",

She is patient and kind, two qualities that are certainly necessary in this line of work.  Deja also has energy and is good at multi-tasking.  In finding someone to take care of my three girls for a few hours, these qualities were also important to me, as I know that they themselves have boundless energy. She is genuinely  happy to care for children, and her passion for it is evident.  Given all that has been happening with the COVID-19 pandemic lately, I appreciate that Deja is willing to take precautions such as wearing a mask throughout her time in our home.  She also understands the importance of hand washing.  She puts in effort, is responsive, and listens well.   I would certainly recommend her as a childcare provider for the reasons stated above and more.    My girls didn't want her to leave, and we look forward to having her come again!",
