She engages our toddler with fun and educational play - going to the park/pool, teaching him letter sounds/numbers/singing songs. Her educational training and experience as a teacher are an added bonus. She even helps with meal prep and leaves the apt clean and organized. We are thrilled to have connected with Kim.",
