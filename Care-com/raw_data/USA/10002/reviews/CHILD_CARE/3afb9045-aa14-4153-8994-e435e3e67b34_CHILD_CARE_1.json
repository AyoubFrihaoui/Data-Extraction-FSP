We are seeking a new caring family for her in the Upper West Side, Chelsea, West Village, Soho, or Tribeca areas.\n\nWe can’t sing our nanny’s praises enough. On top of being a phenomenal caregiver to our children, she is also an educator, who gives caregiving classes to emerging professionals at Cornell, she is certified in pediatric CPR and in nutrition for children. She's loving, thoughtful, energetic, and has become a part of our family. Beyond her exceptional care for children, she helps with managing the household holistically - she is a fantastic cook, shops for us, helps with many errands, and helps keep the apartment tidy – she is truly one of a kind.\n\nIf you're looking for someone who can provide top-notch care, nourishment, and education for your children, she would be an excellent choice. She's available for full-time engagement and ready to bring her warmth and expertise to another lucky family.",
