We only needed someone for a short time because my mother was retiring and taking over. Hannah is everything anyone could want from a nanny. She is truly caring, compassionate, responsible, capable, sensible, nice to be around and always prompt. It was really hard for me to image feeling like I could trust leaving my son with someone I didn't really know for the entire day while I was at work. I was amazed that we found someone like Hannah, someone that I didn't have any reservations about leaving my son with. It is a good feeling to be able to go to work and trust all is well.",
