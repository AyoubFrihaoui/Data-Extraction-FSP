She cared for my daughter as part of a Nanny share from 9 months -2 years and has continued to be in our lives since. She‚Äôs organized, reliable, punctual, love able and cares for children as if they are her own! I believe the term is unicorn nanny! I‚Äôve entrusted her with my daughter for weekends when I had to be out of town for work. As a single mom, it‚Äôs so important to have caretakers you can fully trust and with Kay I do! ",
