I had to find someone after 7pm for the next day and Quesia responded quickly and that was a life saver! She immediately bonded with my son and he stayed content and happy throughout the day. After I told her our kids are in Spanish dual language, she incorporated Spanish and started talking to my son in Spanish, which we thought was really cool. She sang for the baby, did stretches, patiently fed all baby food that I prepared. Thanks to Quesia, my husband and I could focus on work from home. She's very flexible, independent and reliable. Thank you Quesia abs we look forward to having you to our house again!",
