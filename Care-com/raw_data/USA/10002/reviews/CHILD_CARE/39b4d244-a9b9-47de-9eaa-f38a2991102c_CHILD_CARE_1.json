            "displayText": "Shauna is an absolutely wonderful nanny, and we feel lucky to have her in our lives.  Shauna watched my daughter full time from ages 5 months to 18 months.  As first time parents, my husband and I were thankful every day to have Shauna's experience and sound judgment to complement our parenting.  She planned and prepared healthy and fun meals, starting from  introduction of purees to fully rounded meals as my daughter got older.  Shauna read her countless books, took her on adventures around the city, sparked her imagination, and was an overall best friend, mentor, and companion to my little gal.  We were all shocked when we realized that my 18 month old knew all of her letters!  It was all Shauna's daily engagement and teaching.  She kept the house neat and tidy, picked up groceries when we were too busy to make it out, reminded us to increase the flow on the bottle and size up in diapers... When we decided to move out of New York and relocate across the country, leaving Shauna was by far the hardest part of the decision.  It had been our every intention that she would watch all of our future children and be a part of our family well into the future.  She helped us with the move, even coming to Texas for a week to train our new nanny and help my daughter transition.  We are still in close touch with Shauna and my daughter adores the FaceTime sessions they have.  Any family is lucky to have Shauna as a nanny or babysitter!",
