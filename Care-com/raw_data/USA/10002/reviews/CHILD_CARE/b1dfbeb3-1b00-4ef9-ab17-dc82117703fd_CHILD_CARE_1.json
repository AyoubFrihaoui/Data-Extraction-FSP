Lorena was always punctual, extremely reliable and very trustworthy. She was very careful in taking care of our apartment and did a great job as if it were her own. She had a very warm affection towards my daughters.  I trusted her to do school pick ups, play dates and after school activities in addition to her other responsibilities around our house.  I would highly recommend Lorena!",
