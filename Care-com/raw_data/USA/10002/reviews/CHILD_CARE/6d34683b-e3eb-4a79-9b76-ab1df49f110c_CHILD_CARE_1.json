Her genuine love for children shines through in everything she does, from planning engaging activities to patiently guiding them through their daily routines.\n\nWhat sets Nina apart is her intuitive understanding of each child's unique needs and preferences. Whether it's helping with homework, preparing nutritious meals, or providing emotional support, she approaches every task with unwavering dedication and enthusiasm.\n\nAs a working parent, it's incredibly reassuring to know that my children are in such capable hands while I'm away. Nina goes above and beyond to ensure their safety, well-being, and happiness at all times.\n\nIn addition to her exceptional caregiving skills, Nina also maintains open and proactive communication with me, keeping me informed of my children's daily activities, milestones, and any concerns that arise.\n\nIn summary, I cannot recommend Nina highly enough. She is not just a nanny; she is a trusted confidante, a compassionate mentor, and a source of endless support for our family. With her by our side, I can pursue my career with peace of mind, knowing that my children are thriving under her care. Thank you, Nina, for being an invaluable part of our lives. We absolutely adore you! ",

She is a very loving and kind person. I was a first time mom, handing over my infant son to her when I went back to work. She was very receptive to how I wanted things done, was very helpful and really went above and beyond. As he grew she was great at developmental activities, play dates and taking him to classes.
