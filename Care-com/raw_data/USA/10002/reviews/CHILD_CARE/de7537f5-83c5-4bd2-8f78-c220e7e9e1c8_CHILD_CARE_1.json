            "originalText": "Jolene was Amazing! She was very helpful with my 2 year old daughter and 1 year old son.  She cooked. She cleaned but most importantly the kids loved her. We had to stop services with her because we moved to another state. I found Jolene on my neighborhood Facebook group and she was looking for someone who needed a nanny/ babysitting. I am in the household while she is there but because I work from home, I needed the help tending to the kids. Like I said. They love her and my husband and I love her ! She really cares about her job and she does everything so effortlessly. She always has an eye on the kids. They love talking to her.  We have taken her with us on family vacations just because our kids begged us to. Jolene really is a top tier nanny/babysitter. Anyone would be extremely lucky to have her. ",
