Her classroom experience and graduate-level study in early childhood education allowed her to create a highly personalized and learning-rich environment for our son. Much more than a caregiver, Suzanne advised us on developmental milestones and created activities tailored to our child's level of development.  As new parents, we benefited tremendously from Suzanne's' years of experience and her thoughtful, engaging and playful approach to childcare.",
