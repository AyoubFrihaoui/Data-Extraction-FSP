I am a first-time mom and needed lots of help. It was apparent from the first time Kim worked with my son that she has an innate skill for taking care of babies and wisdom that comes from 20+ years of experience.  Just yesterday she taught me about the ins and outs of strollers and the best way to keep a kid warm during an NYC winter.  I am a psychologist myself and can sense that she has an intuitive grasp of how to relate well with others (both adults and children!).  I have observed her to be very loving and caring with my son.  I also like how she applies her knowledge in a flexible and thoughtful manner.  She even volunteered to do more work around my apartment like taking out the trash and doing my son's laundry.
