From the moment Jaida arrived, she made us feel completely comfortable. She showed up early, asked all the right questions, and our daughter instantly took to her, which was such a relief since this was our first time leaving her with a sitter. Jaida kept us updated throughout the night with thoughtful messages, which truly helped us relax and enjoy our time out. She is warm, compassionate, and truly thoughtful—everything we could have possibly hoped for in a sitter. We wholeheartedly recommend her to anyone seeking a dependable, nurturing, and trustworthy individual to look after their little one. She’s amazing! ",
