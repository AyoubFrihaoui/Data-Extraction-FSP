            "displayText": "Marisa worked with us on a daily basis for a year until my work position was terminated, which is the only reason I let this awesome babysitter go!  She is always punctual, makes herself available when needed, even at a last minute basis and is truly wonderful with my girls.  Her primary charge was my 9 year old, who has Down Syndrome.  My daughter is not as verbal as most 9 year olds but has asked for Marisa every day since I started staying home.  Marisa takes the time to read, help with homework, do crafts, go to the park and keeps my girls engaged all day long or after school.  She has made meals when we are running late and puts the girls to bed when needed.  She is so wonderful that we are still using her in the evenings if we have to or want to go out.  I highly recommend Marisa as I find her to not only be professional, but kind, caring and gentle!!",
