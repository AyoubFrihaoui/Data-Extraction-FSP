She even stayed overnight for us on occasion.  I trusted her with driving my children as well.  It is difficult to find someone reliable and trustworthy who is educated and has a good head on their shoulders and Sarah is all that and more.  Sadly she moved away for college or we would still be using her especially for overnights, now that our kiddos are a bit older.  Whoever has the opportunity to hire this gem of a human is so fortunate!  Sarah, thank you for all you did for us over the years!",
