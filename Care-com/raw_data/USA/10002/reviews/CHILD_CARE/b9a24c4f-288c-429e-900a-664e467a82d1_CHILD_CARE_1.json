This is TWO days before the job was supposed to begin.\r\n\r\nI question the truth to her story, but regardless of the reason, I understand that things come and situations may change, however a courtesy call or email would have sufficed with sufficient time for me to find someone else. I am now stuck scrambling to find a new caregiver just days before school starts.\r\n\r\nI would recommend a thorough reference check and interview process before considering her for employment. ",
