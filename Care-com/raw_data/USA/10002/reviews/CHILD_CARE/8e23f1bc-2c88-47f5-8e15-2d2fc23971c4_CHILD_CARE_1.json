            "originalText": "You’ve stumbled upon a gem of a person and would be incredibly lucky to hire Emily. She was with us three weeks after I gave birth, and seamlessly integrated into our family with a newborn and a toddler. She is smart, energetic, attentive, and has great instincts. I’ve joked I can just turn my brain off around her because of how quick and clever she is in problem solving. She’s naturally great with children; both my toddler and baby absolutely love her and I feel at ease knowing how warm and patient she is with them. Plus, she is a wizard at putting down a baby for naps, or getting a headstrong toddler to follow instructions in an stress-free playful way. She is used to screen-free caregiving, which can’t be said about everyone out there. Also, I imagine it’s not easy to work alongside your employer all day, but she and I truly get along (and I consider myself an introvert). She’s incredibly helpful around the house, and has a great sense of what needs to be done and how to do it efficiently. I could go on and on, but I’d be happy to speak more in detail because she is truly amazing and deserves to be with an equally amazing family. ",
