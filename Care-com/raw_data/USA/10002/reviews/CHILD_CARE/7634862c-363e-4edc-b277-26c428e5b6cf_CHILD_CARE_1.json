Outside of the standard attributes you would expect from a good employee, she is just an exceptional person. Kind, prompt, solution- orientated, great communicator, Preemptive, considerate- and this is why I hired her for two different jobs for a duration of two years. If it was not an issue of finances, she would not be on the market right. Come to think of it, she has never been hired. When I checked her past employers/ references, they all either relocated (parents of children she cared for) or passed away (as per the family members of elder clients).",

Our daughter who is now 2.5 loves her and gets excited every time Mili walks through the door, lovingly calling her Mimi.  Since she has started, she put our daughter on a great schedule, allowing her to have appropriate nap times, encouraging her to eat healthy meals and planning activities including  abstract art, painting on canvas, using water colors, using salt art to name a few.  She taught my daughter how to learn more about mammals/reptiles/birds by showing her how to make a peacock, an owl and other animals . She encourages her to learn the ABCs, numbers, colors, and words in both English and Spanish.  She's punctual, reliable and flexible, honest and gives great advice. We are so sad to see her go and will miss her fun, loving personality and cheerful, sweet nature. Our daughter will be starting Montessori school from June 24th which is why we want Mili to find a kind, loving family.",
