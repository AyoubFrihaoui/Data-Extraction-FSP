She made what was a stressful and emotional time into the smoothest transition possible. Fiona is very responsible, dependable and so loving and kind to our now 13 month old daughter. She was super helpful during times like teething and starting solids. If we ever ran late from work we never had to worry. Fiona truly loves what she does and it certainly shows. Seeing how excited our daughter gets when she walks through the door in the mornings is the best review we could get. Highly recommend Fiona!!!",
