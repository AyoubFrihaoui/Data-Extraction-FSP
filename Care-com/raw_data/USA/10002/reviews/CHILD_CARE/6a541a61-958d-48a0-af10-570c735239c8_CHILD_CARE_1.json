She has given us lovely educational books, toys and crafts that we have had so much fun with. I see Melissa with her 5 year old niece all the time and they have a great time rehearsing for music and dance recitals together. Melissa loves children and is very knowledgeable about age-appropriate creative and engaging activities. We are so lucky to know her.",
