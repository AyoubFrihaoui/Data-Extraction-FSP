She's a second mom to the kids as she would also be on a lookout if they were treated well by others and ensure they were always safe, confident and healthy. \r\n\r\nShe's also really fun and sociable, which allowed our kids to make a group of new friends around the neighborhood - we always joke that our kids have more friends than we do!  She'd think of fun activities with them and proactively organize playdates. She would cook and prepare all the children's meals as well. \r\n\r\nI felt completely at ease when I know my children are with Jessica, which is so important when both parents are working full-time.

If she was going to miss a day, she would let us know ahead of time so we can make adjustments. She was a great help to my son. She is lovable, playful and very responsible. She did everything expected of her and took great care of my son and took him to his classes, the park, play dates, etc. She is flexible and does her work perfectly well and with much ease. I highly recommend Jessica to any family looking for a nanny and if I ever need her again I would hire without hesitation",
