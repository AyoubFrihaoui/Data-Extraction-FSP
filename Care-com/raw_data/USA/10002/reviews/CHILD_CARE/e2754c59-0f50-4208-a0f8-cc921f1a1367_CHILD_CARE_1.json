She came to take care of our 3yo daughter, V, during her school’s winter recess, and was quite honestly the best caregiver we’ve ever had, hands down. From the moment she walked in the door and introduced herself to V, their connection was clear, their rapport was fun and easy, and most of all, there were ZERO tears! Throughout the week, V would hear the doorbell each morning and run to the door barefoot, shrieking with delight at the thought of spending the day with Alayjia. This was music to my ears!\n\nAlayjia is calm, confident, kind, and perfectly communicative. Although we had just met, I quickly felt comfortable allowing her to take V all around the neighborhood, to the Children’s Museum, and all the while they had such a blast together. She came up with games and treasure hunts and all sorts of unique activities without my even asking, and the house was perfectly neat and tidy at the end of each day. \n\nAlayjia is truly a gem of a nanny/babysitter/caregiver, and I cannot recommend her highly enough! 10/10 —and more if it were possible to give!",

            "displayText": "Alayjia stepped in for our wonderful family of 5 after our nanny fell ill. We hired Alayjia for 3 weeks Mon-Fri approximately from 7am-5pm. Alayjia went above and beyond what was asked of her and because of that we wanted so badly to hire her full time. My kids instantly took to Alayjia within the first 5 minutes of meeting which shocked me because they're not good with meeting or staying with new people. My boys were 4months, 3 years and 7 years at the time of care. This was during the summer so she managed all 3 at the same time and I must say I was truly impressed. As their mom I'm unable to manage all 3 of my children by myself without any assistance but after speaking with Alayjia and watching her do what I believed was impossible was truly inspiring. Still to this day, I contact Alayjia for advice on certain things with the boys and we have her sit for us occasionally on weekends (there was no way we were letting her go forever :)).",
