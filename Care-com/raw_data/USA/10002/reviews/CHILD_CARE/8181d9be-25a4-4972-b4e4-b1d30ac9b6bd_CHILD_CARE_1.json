Her ability to handle even the most challenging situations with a calm demeanor has been invaluable. When the kids are being fussy with food, she comes up with adorable food art ideas to get them interested. She's extremely responsible when driving, and arranges playdates, discovers fun activities to do in our neighborhood that are beneficial for the kids.\nMy kids absolutely adore her and I am incredibly grateful for the positive influence she has had on my children. I would recommend her to anyone seeking the very best in childcare.",
