            "displayText": "Luz Stella S cared for my twins for four years, from 3 months to the beginning of the pandemic when we moved in with my parents. She is simply superb. Stella managed two babies and little people with love and humor. Her warmth was obvious not just to me and to my parents, who fell in love with her when they visited, but to the neighbors in my building who would tell me how incredible she was with the boys when they saw her in the hallways or the neighborhood. Stella is also a self-starter who wouldn't wait for instructions but would look around the house for things to do when she had a moment, leaving my space tidy and well cared for (toddler twins notwithstanding).  I would give Stella the highest possible recommendation. She particularly loves caring for babies and preschool kids, with whom she is gifted. Her primary language is Spanish (my kids became bilingual!) but she can also communicate in English, with occasional support. \r\nI am jealous of whomever gets to hire Stella - she is one special lady.",
