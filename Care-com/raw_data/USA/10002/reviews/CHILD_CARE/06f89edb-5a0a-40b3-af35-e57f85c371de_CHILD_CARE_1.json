Not easy work for sure, but Estrella always came on time and ready for the day with energy and enthusiasm. She helped train my son to take bottles and sleep in the stroller and was a huge part of my daughter's successful potty training. She is a kind, caring and extremely attentive nanny and a wonderful person. I trust her completely with my children.",
