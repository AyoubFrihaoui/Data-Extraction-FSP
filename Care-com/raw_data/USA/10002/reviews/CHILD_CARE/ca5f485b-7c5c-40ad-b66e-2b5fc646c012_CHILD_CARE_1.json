But that's not the quality that makes for a good childcare provider. Ms. Sherolyn is able to walk that fine line between \"the fun one\" and \"the disciplinarian.\" That is not an easy task, but she manages it with ease, and as such is able to retain the children's respect. Her ability to gain a child's respect convinces me that she is destined to be in this line of work. She has helped our family for over 6 years now and her loving nature coupled with professional experience make her our #1 choice every time.  Kindly Afua J.",
