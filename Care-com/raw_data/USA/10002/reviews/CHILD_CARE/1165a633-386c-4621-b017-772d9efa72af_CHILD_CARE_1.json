            "displayText": "Emma was our nanny for almost 4 years, starting when my daughter was 1.5yo until we moved across the country. Her duties included picking her up from preschool, taking her to extracurricular activities, taking her on adventures and playdates. We were relatively new to NY and Emma took our daughter under her wing, making her a part of her own family of teachers and artists. Emma was patient, thoughtful, kind and nurturing. Our daughter quickly bonded with Emma as well as with her family who became sort of a surrogate family for our daughter. Favorite pastimes include reading together (often numerous times the same book) and nurturing her creativity endeavors including singing and performance. Emma took our daughter on train trips to NYC for musicals, museums and tea parties. She also took her to the voting booth! Always engaging in thoughtful conversation, Emma encouraged our daughter's independence and assertive side. We miss her greatly! Any family would be lucky to have her.",

My daughter loved Emma so much that we continued to hire her when she had vacations from college. She is a responsible, mature young woman. Children always love Emma and Emma loves children. She gives time and attention to every child around her. Last summer Emma joined me and my daughter on a play date with a few other children. Not only did Emma take care of our daughter, but she made sure all the other children were happy and satisfied too. Emma is very observant and aware of children she is in charge of. She is always looking to solve any problems or help a child in need.",
