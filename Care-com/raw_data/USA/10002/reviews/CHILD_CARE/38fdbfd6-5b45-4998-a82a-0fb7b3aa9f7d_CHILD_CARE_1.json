Before coming to us, she was a pre-school teacher, so she has lots of experience with kids and brings a great teacher mentality.  She has helped our daughter grow immensely, including increased independence, improved socialization through interaction with other kids, and potty training, She always goes above and beyond, even preparing activities/lessons for our child outside of work.  She is loving, caring, and reliable.  We view her as a part of the family, and we strongly recommend her to anyone looking for a nanny.",
