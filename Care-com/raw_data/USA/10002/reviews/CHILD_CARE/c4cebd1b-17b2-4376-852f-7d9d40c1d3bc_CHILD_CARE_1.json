            "displayText": "Talula was fantastic!! My family and I were visiting NYC for the holidays with my 9 yr old A. When I talked to Talula on the phone, I expressed worry as this was the first time leaving my little one at the hotel with a babysitter, and she offered to do a video call with us to meet face to face! My daughter instantly loved her and soothed my worries.\r\n\r\nOn the day, Talula was early to meet everyone and spend some time before the adults left. They played hide n seek on the hotel floor, walked around, watched movies, ordered dinner, and more! And when we got back, we got RAVE reviews from my daughter. She constantly sent me updates and photos of A. enjoying herself. \r\n\r\nI'd definitely rehire Talula again. She's a real pro, and I felt secure and confident the whole time! Highly recommended!!!",
