She has been in our lives for over 5 years. Prepping meals, cleaning, picking them up from school, to even helping me out with my work. She is a life-saver and the sweetest angel ever ! She has always been reliable and I wish I’d taken her with me when I moved to Ohio. The kids and I miss her dearly. ",

She was super  nice and so thoughtful to my two boys they were super shy and nervous to interact at first but she broke them right out of it slowly but surely. She knows them like the back of her hand and has been there every step of the way. Anytime I call her she will work with my schedule which is a major plus. Her availability and punctuality are phenomenal! I would definitely recommend her as a care giver !!! ",
