I also personally know several families who have used Ruby to care for their children in their home and as a volunteer at a community preschool.  I've always experienced her as warm, friendly, kind, gentle and loving.  More importantly, my children share the same sentiments with the addition of her creativity and fun personality.  Ruby is reliable, eager, prompt and responsible.  Moreover she's social, has a great sense of humor and seems to always have a smile on her face.  As a parent and professional that works with children in private practice and at a school, I highly recommend her as a care provider for children.",
