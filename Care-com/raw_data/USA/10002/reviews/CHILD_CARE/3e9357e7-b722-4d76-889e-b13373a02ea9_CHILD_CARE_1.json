She is responsible, communicative and yet still fun!  My children absolutely adore her - and, once you meet her, you'll see why!  She is, without a doubt, the best sitter/nanny we've ever had (and we've had a lot):  kind & nurturing, fun loving but sets rules & boundaries, in-tune with kids' emotions, and completely trustworthy.  I would happily provide a reference to anyone considering hiring her!  ",
