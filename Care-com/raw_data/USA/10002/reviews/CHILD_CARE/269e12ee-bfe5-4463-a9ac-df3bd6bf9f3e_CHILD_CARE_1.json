Natalie is extremely thoughtful, attentive, and caring. She quickly established a bond with our son, and it’s clear he absolutely loves her.\n\nShe consistently went above and beyond to ensure his needs were met, whether it was introducing engaging and age-appropriate activities, preparing healthy meals, or helping him stick to his routine. Her ability to anticipate his needs and respond with such warmth gave us great peace of mind.\n\nNatalie also kept us informed with daily updates and photos, which made us feel connected to our little one even while we were away. We couldn’t have asked for a more loving and trustworthy nanny. I highly recommend her to any family looking for someone who will truly care for their child like their own.",
