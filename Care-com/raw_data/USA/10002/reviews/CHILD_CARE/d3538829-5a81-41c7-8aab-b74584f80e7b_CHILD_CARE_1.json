She always came early to get a scope of how the children were doing that day and for any extra instructions I had for her. She was my nanny for a long period of time and I never had one complaint about her. At times I would leave my house a mess because it’s so hard to keep it clean with three kids under 10. When I would get home I would find the house spotless along with food made for the family. Although this was requested and she did get extra pay for it, I never expected her to do it with such ease. As for the children, they absolutely adored her and constantly asked when they were going to see her again. Tereza would take them to the park, museums, library, play dates, etc. and she always had something planned for them to do even if they were cooped up in the house all day. She always helped them with homework and their whole night routine would be finished by the time me and my husband got home from work. She is a great help and I would recommend her to even my closest family members. ",
