From the moment I posted the job, Allison's application stood out.  She was very quick to respond to text and/or care.com messages and had wonderful reviews which was one of the reasons we hired her without previously meeting her 1st.  She showed up right on time for our date night and was great with our two kids (2 1/2 and 1).  As soon as she walked in I felt at ease and could tell she was she had extensive experience with small children from a previous daycare job and as a 1st grade teacher. She was responsive to text throughout the night nut otherwise left us alone and we felt ourselves able to relax and truly enjoy the night.  Would highly recommend Allison to anyone needing a date night sitter.  She was wonderful and we hope she will sit for us again.",
