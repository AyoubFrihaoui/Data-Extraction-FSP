She was excellent with our daughter as a newborn, basically single-handedly helping her learn to nap independently, and has been, if possible, even better with her as a toddler. \r\n\r\nApart from the hours when our daughter naps each day, she and Lidia spend all day outside at the playground or library, where they have a group of friends Lidia has cultivated for them. Our daughter adores Lidia and looks forward to her arrival every morning. More than just being punctual, communicative, and a great care-giver, Lidia is a positive presence to have in and around our home. Any family would be lucky to have Lidia work with their children.",
