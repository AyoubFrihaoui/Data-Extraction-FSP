She has helped us consistently take care of our two kids, ages 4 and 1, but I'm sure we would be great with any ages. She is beyond trustworthy and caring, and handles every aspect of scheduling, feeding, naptime, and playtime. Mostly, what we love about her is that she seems to genuinely enjoy spending time with children and getting to know what's fun for our kids. She is flexible and easy to communicate with. I can't recommend her enough!",
