For example, we don?t ask him to do laundry, but he washes it and dries it and folds it like a professional launderer. We don?t ask him to do dishes, but he washes all the dishes and puts them in the dishwasher, and runs the dishwasher and puts them away. We don?t ask him to clean up the house, but he organizes things like the silverware drawer, the children?s clothes, and the dishes in the cabinets. He also cooks delicious rice and chicken and other Brazilian foods. In taking care of our two boys, ages 12 and 8, he has been responsible, reliable, and always makes sure they are doing what they need to do. I highly recommend him for any job!",
