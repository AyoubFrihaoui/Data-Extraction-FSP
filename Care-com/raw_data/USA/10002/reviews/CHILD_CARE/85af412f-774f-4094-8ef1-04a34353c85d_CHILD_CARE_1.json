If there is something out of place in my home, she will fix it, if there is a smudge on the counter, SHE WILL CLEAN THE ENTIRE COUNTER. Not to mention, it’s safe. Safe for everyone, especially small children who like to touch everything. Children like my kids lol. I have small children and they GET INTO EVERYTHING and as a mother, I can’t keep track of everything, all of the time, so not only does she clean TOO WELL, she takes care of my babies when I go to work, the store or anywhere that requires me to be quick. She’s a huge help in my life. SERIOUSLY! 10/10",
