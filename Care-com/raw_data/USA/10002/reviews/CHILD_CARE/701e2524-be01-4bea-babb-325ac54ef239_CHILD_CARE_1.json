She was responsible for picking them up from daycare on time, taking them to their music lessons, getting them home, helping with homework, preparing dinner, and making sure they were ready for bed. She handled everything with such care, patience, and reliability, making our evenings so much smoother.\n\nThe girls absolutely adored her, and I always felt at ease knowing they were in such capable hands. She was not only punctual and organized but also genuinely engaged with themâ€”she taught them how to make bread, set up a windowsill garden for one of my girls, and held regular karaoke sessions. I truly wish she had stayed in Maryland so she could continue helping out with our family. Any parent looking for a trustworthy, caring, and responsible sitter would be lucky to have her!",
