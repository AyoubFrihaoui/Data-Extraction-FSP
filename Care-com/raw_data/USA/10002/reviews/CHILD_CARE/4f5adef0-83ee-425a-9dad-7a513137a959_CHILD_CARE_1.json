            "originalText": "We hired Alana as a full time nanny for our three month old son. She started on a trial basis and made a good first impression. We were in a tight spot, followed our intuition, and offered her the position. As a nanny Alana is probably okay: 3 stars, or maybe 2.5 stars rounded up. Within her first week of full-time work, however, it became clear that as an EMPLOYEE Alana is extremely problematic.\n\nFor a bit of background, we are experienced parents. (The baby's older sister is a second grader and not in need of a nanny.) Both parents have the flexibility of working from home, and would be available for minor assistance with our son as needed. Most importantly mom would be able to nurse the baby throughout the day instead of needing to pump and freeze large quantities of milk. Alana's job was to be the extra pair of hands needed to attend to the baby, to ensure that he gets fresh air, and help us get him onto a regular schedule. The first day was off to a good start. On her second day, Alana arrived with a heating pad strapped to her abdomen and spent most of the day on the couch sighing and groaning. She was too cramped to work; the extra pair of hands we wanted were mostly engaged with pointing and delegating tasks to the parents: \"could you bring me my water bottle? could you change his diaper for me?\" and so on. Needless to say we were both puzzled by her behavior, but everyone deserves the benefit of doubt, and the next day would be a new one. And on her third day Alana called in sick.\n\nOne thing that Alana did understand is the importance of transitioning a newborn on to a regular schedule. We also acknowledge that, with our son, this task was more difficult than for most babies. We had already started the process before Alana arrived and could help coach her with his cues and what works. In any case flexibility is paramount: if the baby is not responding to one approach, another is needed. Flexibility, however, is not among Alana tools. Rigidity better describes her. As her efforts to get our son on to a schedule over the period failed to bear results, she grew visibly frustrated and even surly. Besides rigidity, other problematic traits in her character began to surface: she can be argumentative, obstinate, demanding and bossy. The requests and criticisms issuing from her grew ever more strident and baffling as days progressed. \"Your floors are too hard. When are you going to start him on formula? Your bed is too uncomfortable to sit on. Did you bring me a soup? The shades in your bedroom are all wrong. What do you mean there's no garbage can in the bathroom? Don't interfere when I'm trying to shush him! But my lunch break is twelve-thirty to one! Where's my smoothie?\"\n\nEven our building's super was dumbfounded at the attitude Alana displayed when coming and going.\n\nAfter a couple weeks Alana's ability to follow direction continued to degrade and it was not clear whether she was acting out of stubbornness or contempt. Her every response was punctuated with some microaggressions – rolling her eyes or sighing and mumbling under her breath. We started to grow concerned for the wellbeing of our son in her care. The culmination was an argument in our apartment where she continually interrupted, talked over one of us, and grew increasingly volatile. That weekend we parted ways.",
