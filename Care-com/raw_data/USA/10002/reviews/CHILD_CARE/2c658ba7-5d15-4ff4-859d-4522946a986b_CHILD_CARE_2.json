Tessa plays with our daughter and engages her, and will also let us know if she notices anything that we should be aware of (for example, last time Tessa let us know about a rash under our daughter’s neck and suggested a course of action).

The quality of care she provides is evidenced by the way my daughter's face lights up every time she sees her.  That aside, she's punctual, knowledgeable (she has aspirations of becoming a midwife), caring, and flexible in a pinch.  She reads, talks to, & sings to my daughter daily, providing a safe & fun-loving environment for her to thrive! My daughter continues to blow past her milestones & I can't help but owe some of her progress to Tessa's diligence & care.  I especially love how her breadth of childcare experience gives me more insight into my child's future growth stages - she let us know what age-appropriate wake windows are, when to ditch the bassinet, what to expect when teething starts, and which solid foods are best to start with.  She often knows which products might be the best (or worst) for her, which I really appreciate, especially since this is my first child.  When I'm not home (working hybrid), I trust Tessa - she always makes it a point to over communicate & send pictures throughout the day to ease my mind.  This review is bittersweet - we're going to miss her constant presence in our home.  We're only parting ways because my daughter's transitioning to daycare fulltime in the fall.  She really has become like part of the family.  We will be sure to hire her for occasional date night care, if available.  Any family would be lucky to work with her!",
