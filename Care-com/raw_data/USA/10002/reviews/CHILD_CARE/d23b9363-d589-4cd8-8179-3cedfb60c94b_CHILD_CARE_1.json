I was her high school teacher, and then she also worked for me in the summer as a swim coach. Her patience with the children was noticed by myself and the parents. She's a great leader, and good with shy kiddos and the boisterous kiddos. She can adapt to all situations. Nora does best in situations where she is respected by her employer and treated maturely as she is advanced in her age with maturity. But she's never too mature or serious to be silly and have a good time with kids!",
