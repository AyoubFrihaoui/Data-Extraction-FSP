She is very professional, punctual, clean, etc. She proactively thinks of activities to take him to (we live on the UWS so there are lots of baby classes, etc.), and has done a great job of keeping him on a fairly regular schedule with feeding, naps, etc. \r\nI'm a first time mom and she's thought of things that hadn't occurred to me, which I appreciate! (Even little things -- for example, she pointed out that he drinks water better from a straw than a sippy cup, so I switched cups for him. She also let me know when he was getting too big for his bassinet stroller and needed to sit upright before I even realized this.) My mom friends have commented to me on how attentive she is with him in classes. She makes sure he doesn't put everything in his mouth, she watches out for older children who might not be so gentle/careful around him, etc. \r\nWe have been so happy with Angelina and plan to have her as our go-to babysitter as our son gets older.",
