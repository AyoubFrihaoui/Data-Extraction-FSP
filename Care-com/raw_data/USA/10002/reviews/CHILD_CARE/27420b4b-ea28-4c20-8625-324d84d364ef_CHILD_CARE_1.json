She is an expert juggling the needs of 2 different age kids that are going through different stages. Also, her problem solving skills are impressive - always keeping the kids laughing and smiling while also making sure the day moves along with everything that needs to be done. The quality that sets her apart from so many other sitters is she truly cares and wants to be there. That compassion has created a bond with our kids that keeps her as one of their favorite people. She is highly recommended, I’d have confidence she could care for any children who needed care AND all will enjoy their time and be safe. ",
