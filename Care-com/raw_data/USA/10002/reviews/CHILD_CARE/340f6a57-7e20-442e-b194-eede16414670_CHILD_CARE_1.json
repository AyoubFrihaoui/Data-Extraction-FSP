My son is not easy peasy.  Ana has some kind of magical rapport with him.  She always has a fun activity planned--today they're going to the Math museum for some event, tomorrow they're going to make lanterns at Pier 57, maybe next time they'll be at a museum I'd never heard of (almost all of these events are free, too).  Where does she find these events?  I have no idea, and no guilt about leaving my son with Ana because he will have a better, more creative time with her than he would have with me.  She really gets kids, and they reciprocate.  For reference, we've been working with Ana for several months, at least once a week for stretches of 6 hours at a time.  I can see us working with her for the indefinite future and crying buckets of tears if she ever moves away.       ",
