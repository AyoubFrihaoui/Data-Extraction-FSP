I can't express the fear I had hiring a baby sitter for my baby, she made me very comfortable and proved to me (being that she had her own kids) that she will care for my son as if he were her own. Alicesa and I met through the app and became friends after being hired based on her loving and caring ways. She is very mature and responsible. I am here for families to message or call if anyone needs reassurance on hiring her! she followed all the rules I had (a lot) and went above and beyond for my family and I without even being asked to. I wish I could have kept her longer! i would strongly recommend this young woman as a care giver to your child(ren) if you want someone to always text/call to let you know their every move with your little angels  ",
