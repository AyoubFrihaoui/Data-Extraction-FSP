My dad had advanced dementia and she handled all of my father's needs flawlessly; some of which included eating, bathing, dressing, exercise and incontinence care. Most especially she became his most trusted companion. Her trustworthiness, dedication and passion was an immeasurable blessing to us. She made sacrifices to accommodate my dad's needs as his dementia grew progressively worse and she was there for him right until his last breath.  I give Stephine my highest recommendation and I say with absolute conviction that any family in need of a caregiver for a loved one would be very blessed to have her.",
