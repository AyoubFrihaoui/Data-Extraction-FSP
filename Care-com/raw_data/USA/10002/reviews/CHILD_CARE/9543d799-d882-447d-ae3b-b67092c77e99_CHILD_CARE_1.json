She taught him how to fall asleep by himself for naps, how to count to ten, worked with him on Portuguese pronunciation and vocab, and empowered him to start learning how to dress and undress himself. We loved that she brought him outside every day, connected with other kids via their nannies, and gave him a small community of toddlers to play with! She traveled with us for about two weeks, and demonstrated that she was great at driving and could handle new situations with ease. We also moved during her time with us, and she was flexible and very helpful during the chaos that was moving. We highly recommend Juliana!",
