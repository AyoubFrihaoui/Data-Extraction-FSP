From the moment we interviewed her to when she entered our home we could tell she had a keen understanding of child development and truly cares about the children and families she works with. \r\nShe taught our daughter how to communicate via baby sign language, she came up with exciting activities like finger painting, dancing, and music time, and took her outside for a walk twice a day. She knows how to sleep train, develop a consistent routine, and fit herself in a household where everyone is home.\r\n\r\nShe went above and beyond her responsibilities often tidying up our home, organizing our daughter's clothing, helping us pack for weekend getaways, and coming up with new foods for her to eat. Meela is insightful, caring, dedicated, and does everything she can to help your child grow, develop, and flourish. She is constantly learning and challenging herself and came up with ways to address the challenges we were having, like sleep training.",
