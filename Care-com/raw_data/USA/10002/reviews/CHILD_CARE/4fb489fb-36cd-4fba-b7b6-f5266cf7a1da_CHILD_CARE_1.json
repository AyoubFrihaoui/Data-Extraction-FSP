            "originalText": "If I could give her a million stars I would. And more!! Having her as a true caretaker in my home has been a huge sense of relief as I know she has a mothers instincts, the energy of a teenager, the wisdom of a grandmother and brings joy, stimulation, love, stability, and tidiness to a home that desperately needs extra “hands on deck”. She cared for my infant twins and toddler- that’s 3 crying babies! She has loved them since she met them, and holy cow do they love her. She is safe in every capacity, truly keen to help when the littles are sick, with cuddles and comfort.  My mother even adores Narna! She is pleasant and warm, yet extremely detail oriented and never has been even a moment late. You can depend on her, you can trust her, she is just an angel.  She communicates better than I could have ever asked for.  I honestly hope she is lucky to get a very very good family for her next role as I think she deserves an environment just as wonderful as she is.  ",
