We were lucky enough to have her for a week as back up care and I would have hired her for a full time position if I didn't already have some one lined up. She kept my 21 month old son busy and active and constantly on walks, outside playing, at the library, or gym with other kids. I never had to worry that he was sitting around watching TV or playing alone because she was always interacting with him, teaching him, and singing to him. She was a joy to work with for me as well since she is so understanding and clearly takes an interest in children and their development. I can't recommend her enough!",
