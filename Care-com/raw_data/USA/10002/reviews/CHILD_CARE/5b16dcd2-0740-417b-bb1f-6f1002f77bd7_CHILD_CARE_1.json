            "originalText": "Suki was with us for nearly 10 months, since my son was 4 months old, she has been an absolute treasure for our son. No matter what time of day it is, she comes in with a burst of energy that lights up the room. My son literally wakes up every morning and looks around, awaiting for her arrival. She makes him laugh so much—way more than I ever could! It’s been incredible to watch her help him reach his milestones, from crawling to walking, and now talking.\nWhat I love most about Suki is her flexibility. She’s always willing to help with household tasks like organizing, laundry, meal prepping, all while keeping our little one entertained and happy. She truly goes above and beyond and is willing to help the family overall in any way possible.\nIf you’re looking for a nanny who will bring joy to your child and keep them happy all day, I can’t recommend Suki enough. She will be an amazing addition to any family!",
