            "displayText": "Andrea is nothing short of amazing. When Andrea first started with us, my daughter was 3 months old and EBF. Despite my efforts she would not take a bottle. I was a wreck. Andrea was calm and patient yet persistent. She taught my daughter how to take the bottle within the first day. She is smart, alert, and picked up on things with my daughter before I did. She really knows her stuff! Andrea took initiative and got to know others in the building and the area right away. She arranged play dates and group outings. She took my daughter to story time at the library, to the park, and to any classes we had signed her up for. She also takes her to Physical Therapy once a week and does all of her exercises with her. Anyone would be so lucky to have Andrea. My daughter lights up the minute Andrea arrives and is always so happy to see her and play with her. We are so sad to have to part with Andrea as we are relocating unexpectedly due to my husband's job. We will all truly miss her and any family would be lucky to have her.",

            "displayText": "Andrea was our children's full-time caregiver from October 2011 through late August 2013 (starting when my children were almost-2 and almost-4). As our both of our children are now school-aged, our needs have changed. \r\n\r\nAndrea was committed to her job. She rarely took any sick time off (maybe 1-2 days during her time with us) and she was rarely late for work (only in the case of significant mass transit problems). My children had different and busy schedules, but Andrea was able to manage those schedules well and get my children to their classes and appointments on time. She had no problem taking my kids on the subway or bus for appointments, play dates, outings to the museums or the zoo. She also initiated and organized play dates. When they were not on play dates, Andrea often did educational activities with the kids. \r\n\r\nAndrea is also a very good cook. She made it a priority to make healthy and balanced meals for the kids every day. Even though my family is vegetarian, she adapted easily and quite well to their dietary restrictions and needs. Andrea also did other things around the house for us when time permitted, like light housekeeping, the kids' laundry and keeping the kids' bedroom tidy. We never came home to a messy living room and she encouraged the kids' independence and helped them to learn how to clean up after themselves (hanging up their packs/coats, putting away their shoes and dishes, etc.).  \r\n\r\nI encourage you to meet Andrea.\r\n\r\nTasha H.",
