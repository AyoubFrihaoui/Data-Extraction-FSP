She was with us for a little over a year and was wonderful with our daughter. She made her breakfast, lunch and helped me sort dinner occasionally before leaving for the day, kept her play area clean, taught her so much including some Spanish which we loved as our daughter started telling me colors and numbers both in English/Spanish and was always up to take my daughter to activities that I suggested. My daughter loved her and was always excited to see her after the weekend which gave me reassurance for when I was away. She never yelled but was firm when needed and redirected perfectly. Our daycare praises us for how well mannered our daughter is and a lot of that is thanks to her. We could go on and on but Iâ€™ll leave it at we were extremely lucky to have found her on short notice and are grateful for her help into this new life transition. ",
