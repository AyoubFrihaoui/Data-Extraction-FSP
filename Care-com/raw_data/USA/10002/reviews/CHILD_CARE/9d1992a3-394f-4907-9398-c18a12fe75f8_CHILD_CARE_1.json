She was my daughter's caretaker for four years starting when she was 9 years old.\n\nI cannot say enough positive things about Ticia. She is a mature, reliable, warm young woman who truly loves working with children. She quickly bonded with my daughter and they developed a close relationship. Ticia is highly educated (was a teacher in Brazil), has excellent judgment, and knows her way around NYC. She is creative, energetic, caring and kind, and above all else very responsible. I never worried for a minute when my daughter was in her care.\n\nIn addition to being our daughter's nanny, Ticia also did light housekeeping and cared for our two very particular dogs who also loved her.\n\nMy daughter is now grown and she and Ticia have remained in touch all these years. They continue to see each other when possible, and enjoy each other's company as adults.\n\nYou won't be disappointed if you hire Ticia as your child's nanny.",
