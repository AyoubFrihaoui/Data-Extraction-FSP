            "originalText": "Meagan was our part-time nanny for our 6 month old until our son was a year old and joined daycare full-time. We absolutely loved having her as part of our family unit. She is kind, warm, and wonderful with children, especially with handling our son’s separation anxiety like a pro and keeping him safe and happy while under her care. She took him on park dates, took care of breakfast and lunch-time feeds, and offered lots of fun and learning throughout each day. She brought such a sense of zen and calm to our home, and went out of her way to really understand our son, his habits, preferences, and routines. She also helped with dishes and organizing all of his drawers (not an easy feat) which took such a weight off me as a first-time, exhausted mom who is behind on chores. Meagan is an absolute gem and I feel so lucky we had the opportunity to have her support in caring for our son. ",
