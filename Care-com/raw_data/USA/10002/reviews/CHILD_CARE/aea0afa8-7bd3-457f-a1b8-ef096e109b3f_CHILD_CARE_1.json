            "originalText": "Elif worked for my family as an au pair for a year, and she was truly exceptional. She played a crucial role in my son Declan’s development, helping him meet and exceed his milestones with care and dedication. Not only is she great with children, but she is also patient, understanding, and incredibly disciplined. She follows instructions well, maintains a structured routine, and ensures that children thrive under her care. In addition to her nurturing nature, Elif is skilled in cooking and cleaning, making her an invaluable presence in any household. As a contract firefighter for the military, training new Air Force personnel, I deeply appreciated her reliability and the love she showed my son daily. She created a schedule that positively impacted his learning and behavior, making a lasting difference in his development. Though we had to part ways due to my military relocation, I would hire her again without hesitation. Finding good help is rare, but Elif is the exception—your family would be incredibly fortunate to have her. She is truly amazing and will give your child the best possible care, setting them up for success in life.",

            "originalText": "I enthusiastically recommend Elif for your family's childcare needs. Elif has been an integral part of our family since Feb 2024, and we cannot speak highly enough of her commitment and caring nature. We were lucky to have matched with her as an aupair and benefitted from the fact that she was already acclimated to the culture here along with her background in child development in her studies back home. She has been responsible for caring for our 2 daughters (age 9 and 6), starting early with morning routine (breakfast, getting dry for schools) to welcoming them back from school (snacks, homework, dinner) along with playtime (crafts, games, etc). Some of the qualities that stand out with Elif is her calm demeanor which is extremely important in young children who can still be prone to tantrums or exhibits big emotions. She will be firm but kind and absolutely reliability with her duties.  She manages schedules (TKD, piano, virtual Chinese classes), meal preparation, and school activities with ease.  As part of our family, Elif has shared her culture (esp the food!) with us and it has been a great learning experience for both sides. She has become like a member of our family, and we will miss her dearly when she moves on to her next opportunity. I am confident that any family would be lucky to have Elif care for their children. Warm regards, Yang ",

It was clear she knew exactly what she was doing, which made it easy for us to relax and enjoy our evening.\n\nShe kept us updated just enough to give us peace of mind, and when we got home, everything was calm—our kid was asleep, and the house was just as we left it. You can tell she genuinely cares and is great with kids.\n\nWe’ll definitely be calling her again and highly recommend her to anyone looking for a reliable, kind, and experienced nanny!",
