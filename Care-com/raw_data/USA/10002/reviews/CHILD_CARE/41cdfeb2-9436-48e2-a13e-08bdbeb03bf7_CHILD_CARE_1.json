Not only did my daughter fall in love with her but I did as well.  She is the most caring, loving and responsible girl I have ever met.  Needless to say, she is still my babysitter but has now become a part of our family.  She is a keeper!!! HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend her! \r\nWarning: there is no way your family won't fall in love with her! She is the best!",
