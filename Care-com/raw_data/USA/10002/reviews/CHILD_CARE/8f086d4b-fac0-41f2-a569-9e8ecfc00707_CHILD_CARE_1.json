            "displayText": "Zoe was the nanny for my twin 5 year old boys the entire summer of 2013 just after her family moved to Sarasota, Florida. Zoe is AWESOME!!! My boys are extremely energetic and she had no problem keeping them entertained and happy. She is very responsible and I completely trust her in all aspects of care for my boys. As a matter of fact, one of my boys had an accident and had to get stitches and she was able to take him to the doctor, get him treated and care for him afterwards because I own my own business and was unable to leave. She is an excellent driver and routinely took them to outings to the beach, arts & crafts store, the park, movies, etc. They absolutely love her and always look forward to her babysitting them when she's home from college on breaks. I cannot recommend her highly enough - you will not be disappointed by having Zoe care for your kids, regardless of their age!",
