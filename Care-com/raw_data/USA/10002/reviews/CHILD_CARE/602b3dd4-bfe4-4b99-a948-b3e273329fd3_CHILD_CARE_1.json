            "displayText": "I met Maria when she was the assistant teacher in my daughter's pre-K class-- I was thrilled (thrilled!) when she mentioned she also babysat. The classroom was wonderful-- exciting, warm, creative-- and Maria was a big part of that. Since watching the kids on the occasional evening, Maria has become a mainstay in our family! She watches my three kids on date nights, and spent two weeks watching with my 3 & 5-year-old this summer.  From the start, it was a very easy transition. Maria's easy to communicate with, professional, positive, kind (while keeping it clear who is in charge), and engaged. My kids always look forward to her coming over, and I look forward to seeing her too!",

Since she was working with somebody else we couldn't hire her as the boys nanny but she watches the boys in the evenings.  Many times we have had Maria come over early and she takes the boys to the playground, plays with them, feeds them dinner and puts them to sleep.  She is spectacular with the boys and they love her.  She is kind, patient, fun, trustworthy, the list can go on.  \r\n\r\nNot only is she great with the kids but I enjoy talking with her too.  You would be lucky to have Maria babysit your kids!!!",
