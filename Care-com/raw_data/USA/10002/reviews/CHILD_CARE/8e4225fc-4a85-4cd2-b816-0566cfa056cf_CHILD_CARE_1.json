Her warm personality and genuine care have made a lasting impact as she supported our daughter through every stage, from infancy to toddlerhood, helping her achieve countless milestones along the way. We only have the highest praise for Paige, and the only reason we are parting ways is due to our relocation. Any family would be incredibly fortunate to have her as part of their lives.",
