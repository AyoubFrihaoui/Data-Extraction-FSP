She started with us in the fall of 2018 when our kids were 7 and 11 and we knew she was the perfect fit right from the start. She was so kind and loving while also being firm when needed. She knew how to strike the perfect balance to both keep the kids on task and have fun. She handled driving duties for school and the extensive sports and extracurriculars for the kids and managed to tidy and cook when needed. We got to see her through her last years of college and her launch from there. She kept our house manageable with 2 highly active kids and 2 crazy busy and a little bit crazy in general, parents. Sheâ€™s the best.",
