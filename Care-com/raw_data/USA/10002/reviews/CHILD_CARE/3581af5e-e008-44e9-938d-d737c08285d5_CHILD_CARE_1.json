She watched my 4-year-old for 10 months, and I couldn't be more grateful for the level of attention, kindness, and nurturing she provided. Ashley  was not only punctual and professional but also went above and beyond to engage my child in meaningful activities that supported their growth and development. She created a safe, fun, and loving environment, and I always felt at ease knowing my little one was in such capable hands. Her patience and positive attitude were invaluable, and I truly appreciated how she adapted to our family's needs. She made a significant difference in our lives, and Iâ€™m so thankful for all her help and care.",
