We felt completely at ease leaving both kids in her care. She watched my daughter who is 4yrs old now since she was 2, and my son who is one since he was born. She knows how to navigate through their moods, and the natural swings of personalities. She handles tantrums and behavior with grace. \n\nSome things to know about Rukminie: \n•\tReliable and punctual\n•\tEngages with children through learning and activities. She has experience in early childhood development and incorporates those skills throughout the day\n•\tFollows instructions well\n•\tPatience and nurturing\n•\tGood Communicator \n\nWe are grateful for the time spent together. Any family would be lucky to have Rukminie in their lives. \n",
