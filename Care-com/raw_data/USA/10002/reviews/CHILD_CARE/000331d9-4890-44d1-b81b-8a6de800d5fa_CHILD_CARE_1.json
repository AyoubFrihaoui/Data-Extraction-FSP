She is an engaging caregiver and role model who doesn't just make sure your child is safe and fed, but also offers the child emotional warmth, and enriching experiences, via reading, helping with homework, asking age-appropriate thought-developing questions, etc. \n\nShe took care of our son from birth through 2.5 and was an immense helper to us, but I can easily see her being great with school aged children, in helping them with homework, taking them to activities, etc. Her teaching background is a wonderful advantage that not all caregivers have.\n\nLilia is mature and has good judgment and not once did I doubt her ability to independently navigate an unexpected situation. \n\nWe are sad that she couldn't move with us when we did and we know she would be a great presence in any child's life!",
