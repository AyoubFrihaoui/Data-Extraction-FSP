I had been having sleep issues with one of my twins and needed to have an extra set of hands at night to keep me on track and not lose my mind in the land of sleep deprivation. In addition to the sleeping issue that week was a deadline week for me at work so I needed to have someone in place to help with the kids if they woke up while I was trying to meet my deadline (in case I needed to work through the night). We spoke at length about the routine, my kids sleep habits, etc. I had discussed with her that I was going to restart my sleep lady shuffle training a few days prior to her coming over in hopes to get back on track so the week would be week two of sleep training and hopefully smooth sailing. I was successful and Judy came in without meeting me or my kids prior and was absolutely super! She is calm, reassuring and a pleasure to have around. We worked really well together and I will be calling her in the future (hopefully she will be available). The last night we had scheduled for her to come my son actually got sick around the time she was supposed to arrive and while taking care of him I lost track of time and didn't hear the doorbell ringing. I felt horrible as Judy waited for a while and then decided to head home. She was unbelievably understanding and concerned about what had happened. She understands that with kids the unexpected happens and she rolled with the punches! She is stellar!",

During the course of the day with our child she sent us updates via email/text and she gracious accepted my 2 phone check ins. She easily achieved our ambitious agenda for the day.

Our son took an instant liking to her. Closer to the date of her own suggestion she arranged to spend the morning with our usual nanny to see the \"routine\", was in communication with us about the details of his schedule via email leading up to the date, and she even scoped out our son's class location ahead of time so the day with him would be seamless. During the course of the day with our child she sent us updates via email/text and she gracious accepted my 2 phone check ins. She easily achieved our ambitious agenda for the day. Our son clearly had a wonderful day with her. We are looking forward to having Judy with us again in the future. Responses well to email/text for busy parents even in scheduling phase as well.",

Judy quickly developed a great rapport with our daughter and we were thrilled.  The second time she came over, she brought coloring pages that made my daughter so happy.
