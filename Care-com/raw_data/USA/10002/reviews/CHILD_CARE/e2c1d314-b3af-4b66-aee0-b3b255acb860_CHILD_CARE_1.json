When she first started sitting for us, our daughter was only four months old and our son was a super rambunctious three-year-old. From the first time she came, Astrid was so prepared, conscientious, and very loving with the kids. She handles everything with grace and I feel extremely confident leaving my kids in her care. She has done many overnights for us, early morning shifts, you name it. And our kids love her. Thank you Astrid!!",

At 5 PM our house and children were immaculate, and we had Astrid's full log of the day's meals, mealtimes, diaper changes and observations. Astrid is punctual, professional, highly intelligent and gifted with children.  We welcomed hearing her suggestions based on her observations and her experience.  We can't say enough good things about her and give her our highest recommendation.",
