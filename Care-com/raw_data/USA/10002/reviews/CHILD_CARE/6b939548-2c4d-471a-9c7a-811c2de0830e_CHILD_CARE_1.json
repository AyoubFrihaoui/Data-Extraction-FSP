She has been caring for our toddler boy since he was about a year-and-a-half old. We were looking for a new nanny after we moved to a new neighborhood, and from the minute we interviewed Lisa and our son met her, we knew she would be a great fit for our family - our son absolutely adores her. Lisa has such a sweet personality and her creativity shines through as she teaches our son fun activities throughout the day, from singing to dancing to painting and drawing. She has even been proactive and searched out neighborhood activities for the two of them to do together - like our library story time and some local sing-a-longs for toddlers. We 100% trust her with our son, she is reliable, a good communicator, follows direction regarding needs and routines, and has even taught us some things along the way too! We cannot recommend Lisa enough!",
