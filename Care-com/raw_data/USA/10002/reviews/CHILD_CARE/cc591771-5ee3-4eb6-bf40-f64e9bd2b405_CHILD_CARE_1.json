Maribel watched A. from the time she was six months old until she was three years old and T. my youngest from five months old until she was three years old as well. What I remember most about Maribel was her consistently arriving  at our home on time, she always appeared ready to engage with our kids, with a smile on. She was always super  kind, compassionate, and understanding . My children really love spending time with her.\n",
