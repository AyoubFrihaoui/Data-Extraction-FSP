            "displayText": "Martha has been the best nanny we have every had. When we hired her last year, I had a good feeling about her, but I had no idea how wonderful she would be with our children and how much we would come to depend on her. She has truly become a valued part of our family. I have two children under the age of 2 years old. Martha started with us when my daughter was 11 months. She is now 20 months old. Two months into her job with us, my son was born. And Martha helped take care of him from the beginning. He is now 7 months old. My daughter has Down syndrome and receives several therapies a day. Martha works along side the therapists and is trained in their techniques when I'm not available sessions. And she carries through the therapies throughout the day. She also has created her own \"lessons\" for the babies too, teaching the babies ABC's, counting, colors and more. She sings nursery rhymes to them and talks to them all day long. My daughter loves Martha and she knows that Martha loves her. She blows her kisses every morning when she arrives and every evening when she goes home. She takes the babies to park and playground and on walks through the neighborhood. She puts in a long day with them, feeding them breakfast, lunch and dinner and getting them down for their naps. She is also extremely dependable and has never arrived to work late. In fact, most days she is actually early. She does a fantastic job straightening up after the children and makes sure they are clean and as well as the areas where they play and eat. I honestly can't say enough wonderful things about Martha. She is a positive and delightful person to have in our home. She is patient and kind and I can tell how much she truly cares for our children and our entire family. We are very sad she will not longer be our nanny. But my husband has gotten a new job outside of NYC and we can't take her with us. Any family who needs a nanny would be lucky to have Martha be their nanny. And if you happen to have a child with special needs, you will not have to worry a bit that your child isn't getting the special attention he or she needs from a caregiver. Martha is hard worker and a very special person. I believe she does what she does because she truly loves being around children. That is not a feeling you can fake. She is genuine. I am more than happy to act as a reference for Martha. If you decide to interview her, I've told her to give my name as a reference. I'd be more than happy to talk to anyone inquiring about her abilities.",
