            "originalText": "Silvia has been working with my family for over 5 years, and she has been an integral part of my kids growth and development.  She started with us when my son was 2 months old and now takes care of both of my kids - 5.5 and 2 year old.  She is one of the most trustworthy, responsible and caring people I know, and I feel so lucky to have met her when my son was young.  She cares for the kids as if they were her own, and she is very much a part of our family.  She has a lot of patience with my kids and she is gentle and kind to them always.  She is experienced with babies and older kids, and has helped me navigate each stage as my children have grown.  She takes my kids to all kinds of different activities, encourages them to socialize and spends as much time at the park as possible to allow them to enjoy the outdoors.  Prior to taking care of children, she was a teacher.  She is well educated and is proactive in teaching my kids new skills, such as reading, writing and talking.  She has helped us raise our kids bilingual - English and Portuguese - and this exposure has helped my kids tremendously with their language and communication.  She is loving and professional, and truly helps me maintain a calm, organized and happy household!  We are moving out of the city and unfortunately the distance is too far for her to continue with our family.  She has my highest recommendation as a caregiver.",
