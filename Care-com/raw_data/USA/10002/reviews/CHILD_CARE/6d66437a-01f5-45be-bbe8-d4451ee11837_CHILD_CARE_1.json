Unfortunately, our kids are now able to get to and from school on their own and we don't need a nanny anymore. Samanthia was very loving, kind and fun to be around. She always communicated with our kids in the perfect manner and was always punctual. It is really heart-breaking to let Sam go and we really hope that she gets a good job, where she could share all her good qualities and love your kids as she loved ours. She's going to be the perfect choice.",
