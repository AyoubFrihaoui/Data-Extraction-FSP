She was also flexible and agreeable even when our plans altered and she had to meet us at a different place. Maddie always smiled and had an infectious laugh. She stayed positive even when my kids were cranky. My kids loved her. Finally, she was able to help tidy up or hotel room. That was a bonus! I would definitely recommend her as a babysitter.",
