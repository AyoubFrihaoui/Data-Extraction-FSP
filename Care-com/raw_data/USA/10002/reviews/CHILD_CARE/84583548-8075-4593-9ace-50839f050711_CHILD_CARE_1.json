I highly recommend Charlie to care for your children whether it's after school pick up, a full day, or weekend babysitting.  Charlie is mature, responsible, engaging, and I'm confident that he can handle any situation that I throw at him regarding my son (play dates, park outings, after school activities, birthday parties etc.).  He great maneuvering the city with my child (bus, subway etc.), and handling any activities that we have going on that day.  ",
