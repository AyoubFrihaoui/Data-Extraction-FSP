She went above and beyond for my family, cleaned the dishes and picked up toys, came with fun crafts, and loved cooking with my toddler. She was very present with my children and played alongside them - building forts, having dance parties, coloring, etc.  She is compassionate, kind, patient, professional, and more. Truly everything youâ€™d want to have in your babysitter. My kids were so excited every time she walked in the house, as was I! Any family is lucky to have her! ",
