            "displayText": "As parents, I'm sure many of us agree that there is no greater comfort when it comes to child care than knowing that the person who you leave your children with each day will nurture them, protect them and teach them with the same passion and tenacity that you hope to give yourself.\r\n\r\nFor the family who's lucky enough to bring Michelle into their life, they get to have that feeling every time Michelle comes to the door.  My wife and I were incredibly fortunate to have Michelle as our child care provider for a year and a half as part of a nanny share that we set-up with our close friends.\r\n\r\nOn a tactical level, Michelle was always prompt (even through many challenging winter days), always prepared and always seeking out enriching activities that our young daughter could participate in. Michelle set up play groups with other nannies, organized a visit to a fire station, attended music classes, found many local activities and always kept the girls entertained, safe and in a fun learning environment. \r\n\r\nBut day-to-day activities don't even begin to describe the value that Michelle provided in our lives. Every day Michelle took on the responsibility of watching our daughter we knew that she was caring for her like she would care for her own. As our little lady grew from an infant to a young toddler we could see her confidence and ability grow in large part because of Michelle's tremendous care and attention to detail. \r\n\r\nEven as our daughter was nearing her first trip to daycare and our time with Michelle in a child care capacity was coming to an end, we saw Michelle, relying on her own experience as a lead teacher in an established child care facility, teaching our child skills and lessons that would allow her to make the transition more easily. \r\n\r\nTo sum things up - I'm not a big fan of writing reviews, but when it comes to Michelle I honestly feel like I would be doing another young family a true disservice by not taking the time to try to make them understand what a valuable part of our life Michelle was (and is) based on the unwavering confidence and comfort she gave us, and our daughter, during her time as our child care provider.  My wife and I still consider her to be a great friend and resource.  Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions regarding our experience with Michelle.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nGabe and Jessica W.",
