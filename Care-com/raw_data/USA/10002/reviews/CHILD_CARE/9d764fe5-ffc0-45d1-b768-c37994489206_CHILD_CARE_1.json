            "originalText": "We called her past employer and they were very happy with her. We invited her to our apartment for an orientation, and she started working. She was at least 15min late every day for the first 7-10 days and finally after multiple reminders she got better. As soon as she started working for us, our 3 mo old babygirl started to get sick and cry a lot every night. Finally we noticed that she leaves the bottles with soap on them in the Sanitizer! We re-washed the bottles she already washed and baby had no issues after that. Finally, she texted us on Friday night at 10pm and 12am she need her money for the last week, and we paid her. The day after (Saturday)she texted us that she will have orientation on Monday to start a nursing school. She never mentioned anything about the school until that time. Now we have 1 day to hire someone to take care of our baby. It was a big mistake to hire her from the beginning, and we should have had fired her once we noticed about the improperly washed bottles. For the safety of your little one, do not hire her., 100% NO hire.",
