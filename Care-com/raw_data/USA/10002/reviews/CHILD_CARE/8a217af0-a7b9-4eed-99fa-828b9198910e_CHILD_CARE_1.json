She plays creative early learning games and develops activities for P (some of which have inspired my own play!) that are age-appropriate and keep P safe and engaged.  She is communicative throughout the day and leaves a journal entry each day.  P lights up in when Daphne enters the room or even just when she hears her voice.  I would strongly recommend Daphne for any age, but particularly if you are leaving your infant for the first-time to return to work.  She is truly wonderful.",
