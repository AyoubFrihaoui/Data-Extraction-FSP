            "originalText": "Flor was our live in aupair for a year. She took care of my 8 and 10 year old daughters including meals, homework, laundry - anything kid related was her responsibility while my husband and I worked full time. She was responsible, punctual, organized, great with the children (8 and 10 at the time) and just a genuinely kind and lovely person. She could walk that fine line between being firm enough to get the children to listen to her while still making them feel supported and cared for. She is very receptive to feedback and easy to communicate with. She was with us during home schooling due to the pandemic. It was such a difficult time for everyone and we could not have survived those chaotic times without her. Even years later, we continue to keep in touch. She is a big sister to my girls. I cannot recommend her highly enough. She will take the utmost care of you children.",

She was an amazing teacher, role model, care taker, and most importantly she became an amazing part of our family. \n\nMy daughter blossomed so much under Flor’s care. Flor’s many talents accelerated my daughter’s reading, writing, math and social skills (manners too!). Flor has an incredible capacity for patience and connection with the little ones and even us grown folk as well:)\n\nWe entrusted Flor to care for our daughter not only on the day to day but also for overnight stays. The only concern we ever had was upon our return if our little girl was going to eat our cooking again, because Flor’s is out of this world.\n\nShe is also incredibly trust worthy. We gave her the “keys to the castle” and she never spent a penny that wasn’t pertinent to the position. She has been a total asset to our family and has loved our little girl as her own. ",
