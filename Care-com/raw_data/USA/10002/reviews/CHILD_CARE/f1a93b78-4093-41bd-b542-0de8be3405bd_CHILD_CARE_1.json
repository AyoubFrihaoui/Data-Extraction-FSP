She watches our 4 and 7 year olds as well as 2 children of similar ages at the same time (4 kids total). She is a safe driver and we trust her to pick up our children from school as well as take them on occasional special trips.\nCindy is unflappable when it comes to high energy kids. She easily earns their confidence and calms them in tense moments, never shaming or denying them the right to express their feelings. She rejoices in their successes and finds ways to help them cope with their fallbacks,\neither with sympathy or humor or both.\nCindy is also a lot of fun! She’s just as likely to play the kid’s’ favorite music at full volume as she is to build a pillow fort or instigate a costume parade.\nWe’ve been lucky for her to be a friend to both our kids (and us!) and hope she’s always a part of our lives.",
