From the moment we brought her on board, she consistently demonstrated exceptional care, dedication, and love for our children.\n\nIn addition to her childcare skills Ava also took on errands, small household chores and took care of our two fur babies. All of which greatly eased our family’s daily routine. Whether it was grocery shopping, organizing play areas, or taking our dogs for a long walk, her support allowed us to focus more on quality time with our kids when we are home. \n\nHer reliability and professionalism were unmatched. Ava was always punctual, organized, and her creative approach to playtime and learning kept our children excited and curious. I always felt at ease knowing they were in such capable hands.\nBeyond her professional skills, Ava became a trusted member of our family. She built strong, loving relationships with our children, instilling values of kindness, responsibility, and empathy. Her positive influence has made a lasting impact on their lives. \nNow that Ava has moved to New York for college, we are all feeling her absence deeply. We’re so sad to see her go, but we know she’s going to do amazing things.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend Ava to any family looking for a nurturing, skilled, and trustworthy caregiver/family assistant. She will truly be a blessing to anyone fortunate enough to have her!",
