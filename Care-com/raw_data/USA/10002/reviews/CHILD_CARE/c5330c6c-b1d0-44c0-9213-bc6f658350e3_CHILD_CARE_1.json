            "displayText": "I interviewed a couple of people on care.com and didn't feel 100% comfortable with them. I was paranoid since I was a stay at home mom for almost 2 years. Then I met Julissa. I had interviewed her and had her come for about 2 hours to babysit to see how she and the kids took together. Because my kids were used to me being home and would usually cry for anyone else. Well it actually went better than I thought, Julissa came over with arts and crafts and kept the kids intrigued the whole time. So we hired her for the summer and she is amazing. We all loved her the same. I never worried about if my kids are being taken care of or if they were having fun. With Julissa I was able to go back to work without the extra stress of worrying . I honestly would still have her with us if she was available for more than the summer. Believe me the only reason she isn't still with me is because of her only being available full time during the summer. You won't be disappointed going with Julissa!",
