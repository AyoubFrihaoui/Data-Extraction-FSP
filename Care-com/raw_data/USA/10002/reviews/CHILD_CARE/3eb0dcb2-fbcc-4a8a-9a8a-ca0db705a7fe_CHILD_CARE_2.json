            "displayText": "All I can say about Rachel is that she is sweet, kind, responsible, clean, reliable, loving, funny and dynamic. She took care of our daughters as if they were her own. She was always on time, almost never missed a day, always brought presents for birthdays, etc., and we will miss her a lot (we are moving back to France). \r\n\r\nRachel is the kind of person you really want your kids to be with. She never raises her voice and always listens to the children; she is studying education and knows a lot about kids. She loves to take them outside (weather permitting), always finds ways to do play dates, brings them to the library, story time, classes, and the park. She taught my daughter the alphabet, colors, shapes, how to write her name, and much more. There is nothing I could not ask her to do, because she does everything out of love and truly cares for the kids. \r\n\r\nPlease do not hesitate to ask me any questions. You will not be disappointed by her.\r\n\r\nThanks.",
