Mary was my saving grace at the time in the midst of the pandemic.  Reliability was key for me.  She helped my now 6yo son thru virtual preK and I had kept her with us through kindergarten even tho everything was back in person as i was concerned at the time about the transition back to in person schooling.  \r\nShe traveled from Queens to Brooklyn and picked up my son from a school in Manhattan, but she was always punctual and very communicative if there were any transportation issues.  she sent pictures of my son when she was with him and always very attentive.  my son loves her and is sad to see her go but our needs are changing as my son is at school most of the time now.  \r\n\r\nI highly recommend Mary to anyone looking for childcare.  She is sweet, fun, caring, professional, hardworking and reliable. Would be happy to answer any questions about her if needed",

Naturally, we kept seeing each other at the playground and in the building and over time I got to see how she interacted with the 5year old in her care.  She was ALWAYS kind to him, instructing & disciplining with grace, understanding and explaining in a way he could understand.  In turn, his response was a consistent love and respect for her- lots of joy and hugs and obedience because he wanted to obey, not because he was forced.  Mary was attentive and consistently had her eye on him at the playground- not on her phone and not engrossed in chatting with the other adults.  I always felt she took her job very seriously, as if he were her own child, professional, kind with great communication skills.  I highly recommend Mary - she'll be a blessing for the next family for sure!  Happy to chat with any family, too, if they want more details.",
