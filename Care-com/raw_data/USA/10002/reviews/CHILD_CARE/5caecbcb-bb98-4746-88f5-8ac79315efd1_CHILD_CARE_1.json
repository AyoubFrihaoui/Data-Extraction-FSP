You can see that she is very caring and patient, and she was always punctual. She was also generous with her food as our daughter seemed to prefer Anabel's to her own! By the end of the second day, our daughter would whimper when it was time for Anabel to leave at the end of the day which shows how much she bonded with her in the short time. We would definitely hire her again if we needed a babysitter. ",

She is very patient with them and always find activities to keep them engaged. For example, she will plan and buy  materials for arts and crafts to do with the kids in the afternoon. She also makes suggestions, especially during the Summer time, to take the kids to parks or museums. If I give her instructions on activities for the day with the kids, she will follow through. She is flexible and happy to try new plans for the children when we tell her. Anabel also helps us with house chores; she will cook for us, do laundry and light housekeeping. Anabel is very reliable and is always energetic and loving. I highly recommend her! Happy to discuss live.",
