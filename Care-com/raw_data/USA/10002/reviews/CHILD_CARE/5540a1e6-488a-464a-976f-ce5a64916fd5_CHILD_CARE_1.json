She is a phenomenal caregiver and person. She is incredibly responsible and dependable, and is also loving and playful. She was a bright light for us during the midst of the pandemic! My daughter (now almost 7) has such wonderful memories of that time because of Chaslyn. A family that finds her is truly lucky.",
