(She moved to Germany, DC, and now CA or we never would have let her go!)\r\n\r\nMichelle is full of positive energy, genuinely cares for and listens to our kids, and is just a fun person to be around. We took her traveling with us. She is just like family. I just can't say enough positive things about her and recommend her enthusiastically.",
