She was able to help manage the schedules of both my children and their afterschool activities. My job required a ton of traveling and Nakiba coordinated the parts of my children’s play time as well as their regular scheduled activities. To this day, I still laugh at how I would be all over the place trying to get the boys together and all she had to say was “Boys, are you simmering?” “Let’s simmer down guys.” And everyone just fell in line. We felt safe leaving for work and confident our children were well attended. I’m really grateful we had her. They had a lot of fun with her.",
