Ms. Cheryl is an innately kind human being, trustworthy, joyful, reliable, and heartfelt. My husband and I have a strong partnership with Ms. Cheryl and love that our son is able to start his mornings with her affection and care. In the past year, we’ve been able to easily communicate schedule changes, additional evenings for date night, and every day matters (e.g., son’s appetite, health, etc.). Ms. Cheryl is attentive and provides helpful recommendations about our son’s development and interest areas. We solicit her counsel and benefit from her education and experience in childcare/children’s development. We have an very easy rapport and solid foundation of trust. We highly recommend Ms. Cheryl and can’t sing her praises enough.",
