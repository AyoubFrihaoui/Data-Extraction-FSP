She genuinely loved to be around the girls and went above and beyond her role of caregiver to ensure they were well taken care of. She prepared their lunches, made sure they were always neat/dressed properly, and even helped me potter train both girls. Furthermore, she researched/organized play groups, library outings, and picnics. The girls always had a wonderful time with her, were socialized, and I never had to worry about them being developmentally engaged. She was always flexible with her schedule if we asked her to stay later for date nights, which was also a big help. We loved having Jessica as part of our family and have missed her since we moved!

Both of my daughters have food allergies, and not only does she do an excellent job monitoring what they eat at home but she also pays attention to what others near them eat when they’re out at the playground. It gives us great peace of mind to know she is so careful. Our girls love her - she plays dolls, has dance parties, and builds towns with our railroad set. When it’s nice out, they go out on walks and to the playground. Once Jessica knows where things are in the house like strollers, snacks, and the diaper bag, she takes initiative to get things set up for walks on her own. The same goes for meals. She will follow schedules left by us but also has handled some emergencies, and we trust her judgement. Her years of experience in childcare and with her own children are apparent - she calmly handles the worst toddler tantrums and sibling disagreements. Jessica is like part of our family - we highly recommend her!",
