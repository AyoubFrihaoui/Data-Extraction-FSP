We have great confidence that our kids are safe, happy, and stimulated throughout the day.  She does light housework and is great with our pets.  Addy has brought creative projects for the kids to work on and plays with them all day in a variety of fun and creative ways.  My kids are going to miss her very much.  We have very energetic kids (2, 4, and 6 years old) and Addy makes caring for them look easy.  She is very reliable and is on time every day.",
