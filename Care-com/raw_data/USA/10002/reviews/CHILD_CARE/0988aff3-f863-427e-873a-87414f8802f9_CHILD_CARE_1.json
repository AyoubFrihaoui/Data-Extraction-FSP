She came to work with us as an afterschool sitter for our three kids (ages 12, 10, 6) and I'm not entirely sure how we ever functioned without her!  Kylie is dependable, communicative, and flexible. She's great with our kids, they love her and enjoy their time together.  Recently we've had Kylie watching them at the pool and numerous other parents have approached us to let us know what a great sitter she is.  We hear from other parents that she's attentive and engaging with the kids.  We're very sad that she's leaving the DC area and would absolutely recommend her to a family in her next location!",
