We were planning on having her take my 13 and 10 year old to Roosevelt Island. My 6 year old really wanted to go as well. She did not even bat an eye and took him along as well. I got the sense that she was genuinely interested in my children and spoke to them as individuals. I would recommend her as a babysitter.",

She was tasked with after school care extending into evening hours and several times overnight during a season of extremely demanding work hours and travel.  Our expectation was that she would drive the children to activities, prepare dinner, help with homework as needed, and see the children to bed.  Sarah handled these tasks with finesse and on several occasions went above and beyond.  As the oldest of 3 (but foster sister to many!), Sarah comes to childcare with a keen sense of play, kindness, and humor but also models responsibility and high standards.  She taught my oldest how to make an entree she learned to make during her travels in Morrocco; she lavished my youngest with attention when she braided her hair or painted her nails.  She kept in touch with us so that we were in the loop about the day-to-day, but also guided the children appropriately as needed, when we couldn't.  She is tidy and efficient, and holds healthy boundaries between work and personal life.   I recommend her without hesitation.",
