She was following my strict instructions for feeding my child only healthy food and kept her active and entertained both at home and in the park. I have been relying on Afnane for taking care of my 4 years old daughter since she was born. At different stages of development, Afnane made sure to attend to my childâ€™s physical, psychological, cognitive and social needs. I wonâ€™t substitute Afnane with anyone in this world.

Sheâ€™s been an incredible babysitter and night nanny for my three infants over the past 4 years. She is truly exceptional in every way â€” patient, caring, and so dedicated to the kids. From late-night feedings to providing peace of mind when I needed rest, Afnan has always gone above and beyond. I trust her completely, and sheâ€™s the only nanny I will ever consider in the future. If youâ€™re looking for someone reliable and loving to care for your little ones, Afnan is your person!\"",
