Our daughter adores her, and really thrives thanks to Sarah's attentive, loving, and thoughtful interactive plays and communication through sign language and verbal communication. Sarah is knowledgeable in sign language and taught our daughter several helpful words that helped so much in our daily lives. She truly cares for our child. They have built an amazing relationship. Sarah balances freedom and structure extremely well, and we think it contributed greatly to our daughter's development. Sarah is probably the most trust-worthy caretaker in our family. She is also collaborative, and work with us as a team. The love and trust our daughter has for her really is the only testimony needed to demonstrate Sarah's capability as a successful and trust-worthy caretaker.",
