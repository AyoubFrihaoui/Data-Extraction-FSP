            "originalText": "Bridget worked as a nanny for our 3 children for over 3 years. When she first started, the kids were 2, 6, and 8 and they were 5, 9, and 11 when the job ended because my youngest went to kindergarten.  During those 3 years, we got to know Bridget very well.  She is reliable, creative, self-motivated, and calm and level headed no matter what my 3 kiddos threw her way.  My kids are very involved in sports and other activities and she managed pick ups, drop offs, hair buns for dance, make up for recitals, and countless runs to soccer practice.  We were initially on the fence about hiring a nanny, but hiring Bridget was one of the best decisions we made for our kids!  ",

Bridget and I had a trusting relationship and I considered her a member of our family. She is compassionate and calm. We managed childcare, discipline, and challenges that came as a team together. Bridget helped take our daughter to and from preschool. She helped with light housework and our dog. She also adhered to our kids' schedule, daily routine, and helped potty train both children. Due to the circumstances of the current pandemic and COVID-19, our family was not in the need of additional childcare.
