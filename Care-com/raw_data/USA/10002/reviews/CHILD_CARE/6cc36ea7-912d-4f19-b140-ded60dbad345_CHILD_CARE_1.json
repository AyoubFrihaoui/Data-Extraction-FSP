If I needed to run errands, work late or just have some \"me\" time, Lee came to my home on time, cheerful and ready to engage in any activities my daughter had planned. My daughter love Lee (and still does til this day), and looked forwarded to spending time with her. \r\n\r\nI also would like to recommend Lee as a dog walker. My daughter and I share our home with our three furry babies as well. Not only did her love for my daughter stand out but also her love and compassion for animals. Lee would feed my cats and walk and feed my doggie. My animals love her and I know they are well taken care of. ",
