Even though Mariana was not taking care of our daughter but a friend's daughter, she took great care and paid attention to our (then infant) daughter. They had an immediate connection. Since then, we have often hired Mariana to take care of our daughter (now 26 months old). Mariana is honest, trustworthy, and gets along so well with children. (I trust very few people with our daughter, but I completely trust Mariana.)  She is kind and has a great personality. Most important, our daughter loves her and gets so excited whenever she comes over. I give the highest recommendations for Mariana!",
