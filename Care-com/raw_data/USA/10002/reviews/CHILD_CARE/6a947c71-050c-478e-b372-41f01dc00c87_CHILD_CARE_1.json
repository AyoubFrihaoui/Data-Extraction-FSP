She was also able to get my 1 year old off of the baby bottle even when I couldn't do it. He's learned body parts and animal sounds with her.  She encompasses all that you would need and want in a caregiver for your child. I trust her and never had to worry when my kids were with her. The only reason she is no longer with us is because we moved out of state otherwise I would have been happy to still have her.",
