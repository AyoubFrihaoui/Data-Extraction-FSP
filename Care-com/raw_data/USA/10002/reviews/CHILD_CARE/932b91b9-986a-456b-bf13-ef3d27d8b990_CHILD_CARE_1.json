I was nervous and probably more anxious than normal but Phai was amazing.  In addition to her knowledge and experience, Phai was communicative, dependable, and punctual.  Everything I could have asked for!  I highly recommend her!  Thank you!",

She would also take him to fun music classes in the neighborhood. She is so easy to work with and a great communicator.
