My daughter is 8 and has emerging Spanish skills including reading and conversation.  Daisy listened to her reading books and gently helped her with a the more difficult words along the way. Then they talked about the animals in the books. They played with my daughter's dollhouse and they also played board games including Candyland and Guess Who, both in English and Spanish. I am definitely keeping Daisy on our list of approved sitters and am recommending her to other families! She would also be great with a baby or toddler. Very gentle and kind.",
