            "originalText": "If you are looking for a nanny, look no further! There truly is not a better nanny out there. Izzie has been our nanny for the last 1.5 years. We are moving out of NYC and I could not be more sad to be losing her. She arrives each day with a positive, cheerful attitude; she is creative and always coming up with new and fun activities to do with my toddler and she never turns on screens!; she does her own research on age appropriate activities and milestones that we should be working on; she is incredibly respectful of me and my goals for my daughter and good with communication; she is very helpful around our apartment- both with cleaning up after my kids and helping me and my husband with our laundry, keeping the apartment clean, etc. I cannot stress enough what a go-getter type of person she is. We have been blown away by how proactive she is. She is always looking for ways she can help us and does things that we have never asked her to help with. She has also been very helpful/ supportive through my 2nd pregnancy and postpartum experience and has been wonderful with our newborn son the last several months. Our 2-year old is very energetic and she quickly figured out how to juggle both kids with patience and grace. \n\nI work from home and as such I have spent ample time around Izzie and seen first-hand daily how she is with my kids. Not only has she been an incredible nanny for my children, but I have really enjoyed my time with her and think of her as a friend. I cannot recommend her enough! ",

She built a rapport with our son very quickly. I'm also so grateful because Izzie really took my safety concerns to heart. Safe sleep is very important to me, and I told her what we expected (ABC's and all that), and she always followed it perfectly. She is very skilled at engaging our son. She is constantly talking to him - asking questions about the toys they were playing with, reading to him, engaging him during routines. As an early childhood educator, I am so impressed because not everyone can foster development like that. Izzie asks great questions and is really helpful at keeping lines of communication open. She's punctual and professional. She is great with our pets too! If Izzie was staying in the area, we would totally continue using her as our nanny. She's great - you're going to love her and so will your kids!",
