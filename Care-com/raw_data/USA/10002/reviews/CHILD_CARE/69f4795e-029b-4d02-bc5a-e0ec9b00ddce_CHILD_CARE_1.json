She has a beautiful positive and exuberant energy which can be both soothing/calm and energetic. She is CPR and First Aid Trained. She is punctual and a very good communicator. Her love of children is palpable when working with her. She loves to discover their unique gifts and support them. I am delighted to recommend her.",

I've personally seen her with the children of the family she babysat for for many years. She listened closely to the ideas and needs of each of the children and took her role as caregiver extremely seriously. Annabelle is punctual, professional, caring, and most importantly, fiercely kind.
