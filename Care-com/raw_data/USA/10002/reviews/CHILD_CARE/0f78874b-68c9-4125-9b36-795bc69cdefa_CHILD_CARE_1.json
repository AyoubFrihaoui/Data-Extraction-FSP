She helped us care for our children when our oldest was 1.5yo our middle child was 4weeks, and cared for our youngest from birth. We trust her 100% with our kids and she treats them as her own. As our children are now entering school age and our schedule needs have changed, we are so sad that she will no longer be with us on a regular basis. She would be a wonderful caregiver for any family! She helped us with daily care, bringing them to preschool, taking them to their activities, supervising them at the park/library/pool, finding fun activities like nature hikes and farm visits. We also love that she has taught them about healthy eating and nutrition from a young age! She is a safe driver, she’s helped us establish a daily schedule, she’s helped us with napping and sleep regression, as well as potty training. She is truly the best, we highly recommend her! ",
