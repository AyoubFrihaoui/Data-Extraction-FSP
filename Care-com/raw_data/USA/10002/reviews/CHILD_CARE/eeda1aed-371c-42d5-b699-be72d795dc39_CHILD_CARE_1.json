She was punctual, kind, extremely patient, and she went above and beyond to make sure our child felt loved and cared for.   We aspired for a caretaker that didn't just babysit our daughter, but take an investment in making sure she was hitting all of her development milestones and prepared her for school.  Debbie did all of those things including helping her learn to walk, talk, learn her colors, numbers and letters, and play well with others by planning play dates with children they met throughout the day.  Debbie treated my daughter like her own and she became like family.   In addition to her wonderful caretaking skills, Debbie was also extremely diligent about cleanliness, washing hands and toys on a regular basis and making sure that my daughter learned the importance of cleaning herself and cleaning her spaces.  Debbie was a joy to work with and my daughter misses her immensely.    Anyone would be lucky to have her as their child's caretaker and you should reach out to Debbie immediately if you want your child in the best hands. ",
