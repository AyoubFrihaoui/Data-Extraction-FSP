We were extremely nervous hiring someone to take care of our 8 month old (at the time) and Carly was absolutely incredible. She took care of our daughter for 3-4days a week for about 9 months and we wish it could have been longer but she moved back to New York (which she was 100% upfront with us about from the very beginning). Our daughter loves and misses her very much. We completely trusted her -  she would take our daughter to the park, on long walks, to play outside and would even be able to entertain her in our small house on rainy days. She would feed her snacks and lunch as needed. We would absolutely hire her again and I will be happy to be a reference for anyone that has questions! She truly went above and beyond in so many ways - you would not go wrong with Carly.",
