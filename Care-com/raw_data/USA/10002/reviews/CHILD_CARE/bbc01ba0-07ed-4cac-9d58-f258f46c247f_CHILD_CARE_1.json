She's been a great help, she's reliable and very punctual- always arrives on time. She does homework with each kid and then has fun with them they'll play games or watch a movie- the kids like her a lot! She's taken the boys to birthday parties for me and is very good when it comes to last minute help- if she's available she's always willing to come help out.",
