She was SO good. \r\n\r\nI still chuckle when thinking about her playing with our son - who was between 15 months to 2 1/2 years-ish during the times she sat for us. Paula was so kind and engaging. She played puppets with the most amazing voices. She was kind, patient and compassionate. Paula was always on time and we trusted her fully.\r\n\r\nOur only regret is that we couldn't hire her full time! She was already working with a family, so we were able to hire her to watch our son intermittently, but we would've hired her as our regular nanny in a heartbeat.",
