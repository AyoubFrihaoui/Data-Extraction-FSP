They had just flown from Australia to NY, so the kids were jet lagged and disoriented, to say the least :) But somehow, the kids had a blast with Kim, she helped them get back on a reasonable sleep schedule, and made them feel totally safe and at ease in this new place with a brand new person. \n\nThe weekend went off without a hitch thanks to Kim's reliability -- my brother and his wife were able to be totally kid-free for two nights and completely confident in their kids' happiness and safety while they attended the weekend wedding events. \n\nWould recommend Kim to anyone for any job! Short term, long term, any age, etc. She was great. ",
