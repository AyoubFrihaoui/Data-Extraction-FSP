            "displayText": "We were happy to have had Barbra as our full time nanny  Unfortunately we no longer need a full time nanny, but we highly recommend her for any position she seeks.  She worked for me as a Nanny from February 2016 until July 2017.  She took care of my children, who are 4 and 7 Years old.  She is reliable, fun, loving, punctual, caring, responsible and trustworthy.  She loves kids and is very patient with them.  I felt comfortable that when I went to work, my kids would be safe and happy with Barbara. She always came to our house on time, cheerful and ready to help the kids through the morning routine; for example, make sure the children are ready for school. She is a great listener, intelligent and was always open minded to new ways on how to take care of the kids as we thought necessary. Her education and knowledge of childhood development was an added benefit to our children. But she always followed our direction in regard to the children (Roles, food, etc).",
