They are an old soul who is affectionate, attentive, reliable, and knowledgeable of children's needs at various stages of development. They drove our two kids (then 3 and 7) to the zoo, walked them to parks, read and sang to them, prepared meals, and otherwise helped keep our household going during a rocky year of lock down. Since graduating and leaving Pittsburgh, Eve has been sorely missed and we continue to stay in touch and make visits.",
