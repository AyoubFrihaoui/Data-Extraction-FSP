            "displayText": "Cherry has been a part of our family for almost 2 years as a part time nanny. We are very sad to let her go since I am going back to work soon and will need a full time help. \r\nI can't say enough about how wonderful she's been with our daughters and around the house. She's been a positive influence to our older daughter who is now almost 3 and takes a wonderful care of our younger daughter who is 8 months now. Cherry is extremely kind, patient, caring to our kids through both the good and the inevitable tantrums and also very bubbly and playful. A mother from her school came up to me to tell me how great Cherry is with here and as well as other kids. It's a testament to her amazing character. She also has kept our house very tidy and clean with light chores during baby's nap times. \r\nWe all love her dearly and we are sure that the new family will love her as much as we do. ",
