Mia was incredibly reliable, kept great communication, and was an excellent addition to our family during this time. She assisted with essential tasks like bath time, diaper changes, feedings, tummy time, maintaining our diaper bag, taking care of the baby's laundry, and diligently keeping track of all these responsibilities. Mia truly made our summer journey much smoother and stress-free with her caring support.",
