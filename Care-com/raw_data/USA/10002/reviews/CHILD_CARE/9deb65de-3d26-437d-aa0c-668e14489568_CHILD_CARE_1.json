If Neveen were a star of 90s-00s situational comedy, she's Courtenay Cox plus Sarah Jessica Parker plus Julia Louis-Dreyfus. She's the most thoughtful, caring, capable, professional, hardworking and fun person you could hope your kid to have caring for them. In a world of under-livery, Neveen over-delivers. She is exceedingly competent and kind, completely trustworthy, scrupulously honest and emotionally generous. We have been immensely lucky to have Neveen care for our twin daughters since they were days old. They adore her, we adore her, and we count her as a real friend too. She has our absolute and unreserved recommendation.",
