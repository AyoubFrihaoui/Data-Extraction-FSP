I had a last minute change in my travel schedule and had to hire someone in a pinch without being able to meet in-person, and Hannah came through in a major way! Hannah was communicative, kind and very attentive. She was able to handle daycare pickup and begin his evening routine for the two nights we needed her help. She gave me so much relief as a first-timer (using this service) who was away from home. My son adored her and she helped keep his evening routine on track as though she had done this a hundred times. I am so grateful for her support and would hire her again in a heartbeat. I highly recommend Hannah's care to anyone who needs it! Thank you so much, Hannah!",
