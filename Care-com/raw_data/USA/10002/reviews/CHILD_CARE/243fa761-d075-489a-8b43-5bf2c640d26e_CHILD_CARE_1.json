She joined our family when our son was 3 months old and cared of him and our second child, a daughter, who was born 4 years after Dolores joined us.\r\n\r\nDolores was more than a nanny - she was a second mother to our children and a cherished friend to us all.  The children flourished under the love and care and nurturing of Dolores.  They loved her and still keep in touch with her.\r\n\r\nI would highly recommend that Dolores join your family and that you treat her with love and respect - as she will you.",
