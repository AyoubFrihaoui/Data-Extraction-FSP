I was nervous about hiring a stranger to care for my only child. I interviewed several nannies and I knew Daphne was \"the one\" right away. I went with my maternal instincts and I am so glad I did. My daughter LOVES Daphne.  Daphne is great with my child-very engaging, playful, loving and careful.  She brought a composition book with her and since day 1 she has been recording my child's everyday activities, nap, feeding and diaper changes.  Daphne keeps me up to date via text regularly during the day.  She is happy to do light house keeping and I always come home to a neat + tidy home.  She is an extremely honest person and is never on her cellphone.   Daphne is more then a nanny to us, she has become a part of the family. My husband and I are both physicians w/hectic schedules and she makes our lives much easier. I recommend Daphne without reservation! ",

In addition to classes or activities I've set up, Daphne takes him for walks, plays with him at the playground, reads, sings songs and plays games with him in our home.
