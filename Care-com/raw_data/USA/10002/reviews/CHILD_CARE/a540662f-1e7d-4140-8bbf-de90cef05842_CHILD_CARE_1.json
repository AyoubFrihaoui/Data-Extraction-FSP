However,  during my last months with her, I had to relocate to Chicago from NYC, she lived in with us for a month to help me get settled in the new town. Through these experiences,  I have gotten to know her very well. \r\n\r\nI can say with high confidence that she is a very smart, diligent, caring and a genuine person. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, even without me asking, she always made sure that my baby was fed well, bathed, in clean clothes, and well slept. Also, she took such great care of her when my baby had her first shots, first fever, through all the difficult challenges. But beyond that, she knew exactly how to play with her, suitable for each stage of her development. More importantly, I could see that she loved my baby and my baby absolutely loved her.",
