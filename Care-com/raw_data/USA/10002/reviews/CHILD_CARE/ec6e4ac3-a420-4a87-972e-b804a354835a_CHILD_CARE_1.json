            "originalText": "We hired Marielle/Ellie as a nanny for 3 weeks in Jan 2025. It didn’t work out. We ran into issues with her reliability, supervision & judgment, and inattention to basic hygiene for our son in diapers. \n\nIn her time with us, Marielle called out sick twice, giving us less than one hour's notice both times. She also no-showed twice without any communication. \n\nWhile she showed initiative in planning activities like science experiments, these were done a bit carelessly. In one incident, she permitted water play on our living room carpet. In another, she used an entire bottle of food coloring while doing water play on our hardwood floors. The dye stained our son's skin for several days despite regular bathing. But the kids had fun, and this alone wouldn't have been a reason to end the arrangement.\n\nOur biggest concern is that she demonstrated an inability or unwillingness to change dirty diapers. We discovered our 18-month-old son had dried remnants of the day’s dirty diapers on his skin on 4 different days, which aggravated his diaper area.\n\nPositive Notes: She was punctual when she did come to work, showed enthusiasm for planning activities, and was polite.\n\nMarielle might be better suited for older children (age 7+) who have reliable back up care. \n\nI cannot recommend her for infants or toddlers due to the basic care issues and reliability concerns.",
