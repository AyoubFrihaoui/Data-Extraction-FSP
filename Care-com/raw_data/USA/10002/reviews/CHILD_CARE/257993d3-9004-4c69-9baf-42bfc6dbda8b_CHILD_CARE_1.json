            "originalText": "I enlisted Michael to assist my elderly father-in-law, who suffered a traumatic brain injury a year ago and exhibits symptoms akin to early-onset dementia. Michael proved to be an exceptionally caring and dedicated aide to my father-in-law. He collaborated with my mother-in-law to enhance the safety of their living space, reducing the risk of falls and injuries. Michael diligently assisted my father-in-law with his physical and occupational therapy exercises, effectively augmenting the level of skilled services we were already investing in. He attended to any needs my father-in-law had and ensured he was prepared for the evening, which typically posed greater challenges. Throughout Michael's tenure, we witnessed remarkable improvements in my father-in-law's health, leading to increased independence. Moreover, Michael imparted invaluable knowledge to our family on safely caring for him. I wholeheartedly endorse Michael as an aide to anyone in need and am available as a reference should you wish to contact me.",
