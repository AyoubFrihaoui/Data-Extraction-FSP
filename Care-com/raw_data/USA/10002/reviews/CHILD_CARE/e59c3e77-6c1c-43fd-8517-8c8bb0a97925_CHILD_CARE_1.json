The first time she informed us a couple hours before the meeting time that her friend was going to active labor (which was understandable). We rescheduled to meet two days after the original date; the day of I had to follow up twice and she finally told me a couple hours before the meeting time that she has a fever and she thought she had responded to my text. I am aware that Zaman may be telling the truth and it was just bad timing for us; I am disappointed as she could have just told us if she is not able to make it. Twice in a row in the same week feels a bit too much of a coincidence. We were excited to meet her given her exceptional reviews on care.com but were disappointed that we did not have the same experience. ",
