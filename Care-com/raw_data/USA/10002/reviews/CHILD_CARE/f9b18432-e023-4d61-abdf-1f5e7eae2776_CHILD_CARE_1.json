Most importantly, my son adores her & loves going to her house. The 1st time we hired her, she sent me photos every so often which meant so much to me, I  got to see how comfortable he was, what he was doing & he was having a blast.  And the 2nd time she watched him, she taught him sign language. She's so talented. I highly recommend Ijeoma.",
