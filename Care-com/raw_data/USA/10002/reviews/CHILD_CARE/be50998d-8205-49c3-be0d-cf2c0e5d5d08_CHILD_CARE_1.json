Meghan was a favorite in our house until she moved to NYC a few years ago.  She does it all! My kids adore Meghan and it’s no wonder as she played so lovingly and enthusiastically with them.  Meghan, also drove my kids safely to activities, got and served them meals and even helped me put together furniture and Christmas presents for the kids when they were napping.  I wish we still had the joy of having Megan in Chicago, but now a lucky NYC family will be as fortunate as us. ",
