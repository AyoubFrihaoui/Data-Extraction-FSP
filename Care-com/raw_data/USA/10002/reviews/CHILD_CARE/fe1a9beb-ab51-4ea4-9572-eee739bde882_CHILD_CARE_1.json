She is always willing and able to help others. Desiree has always been very attentive to her sisters and brother as well as people in general. She has a beautiful 4-year-old goddaughter that she plays an important role in her life even though she relocated to North Carolina. She is very involved in her life physically, emotionally and mentally. She has a lot of cousins that are all younger then her because she is also the first grandchild. She has helped in more ways then one from changing pampers, to giving baths, to reading books, taking them to the park or laying back and watching TV. Not to be so personal but Desiree was not only a sister to her twin sisters that came from my second marriage but played a father role in their lives. My best friend just asked Desiree if she would take the honor of baptizing her daughter as well. Desiree is such a delight to be around and I don't say that because she is my child but because it's the truth. Once you meet her you will see for yourself what a pleasant individual she is. She is very loving and compassionate. I pat myself and her father on the back for raising such an amazing daughter. Desiree graduated from a Culinary Institute located in Manhattan and graduated from Queensboro College. Desiree majored in Liberal Arts to just getting accepted to quite a few top colleges. She chose to go to Hunter to further her education in Social Work for abused children. I am so proud of her and I am so proud to call her my daughter. All I ask is to set up an appointment to meet her and you won't regret it.",
