            "originalText": "It is my pleasure to give an unqualified recommendation of Shanee for a caregiving position.  Shanee was my mother’s companion from approximately 15 month until mom passed away.  I have no doubt we would have kept Shanee with us (if she wanted) had mom lived another decade or more.  \n\nMom had dementia and like many living with memory problems, did not recognize her very real limitations.  She did not want to be handled or cared for and we had several situations before Shanee that did not work out.   \n\nShanee, however, was able to care for mom without her knowing that she was being cared for.  She was a lively friend and companion who engaged mom and genuinely enjoyed spending time with her.   Shanee quickly became part of the family and took it extremely hard when mom’s health deteriorated.   She was my trusted “boots on the ground” both before and during the significant health issues that ultimately led to my mother’s passing.   \n",
