            "originalText": "Deserie has been the most wonderful nanny we could have ever asked for. When she first met our baby at 3 months old, the way she held her and cared for her and knew how to calm her really gave me a sense of trust in her as a caregiver for my baby. The “baby whisperer” is the truth when it comes to her! \n\nShe was with us when our daughter was 3 months old to 7 months old and she was reliable, warm, and I trusted her with my baby. Her and my baby had developed a true bond and anybody could see it! She has a great amount of experience with caring for children and knowledge when it comes to child development and used these skills with my baby regularly. She gave a lot of structure to the day when she was with my baby and we saw a lot of progress when it came to my baby’s development which we have to thank Deserie for. She was also very focused on child safety which gave me a lot of reassurance. We felt that she was a part of our family.\n\nShe was also extremely kind to us as a family and, as new parents, she was there to support us and give us advice and tips as new parents. She would constantly send us items that she recommends for our baby and her development and was constantly thinking about us as a family. \n\nWe are planning to put our daughter into daycare but if we weren’t, we would plan to keep Deserie as our nanny. Any child that has Deserie in his/her life would be lucky! \n\nWe would absolutely recommend Deserie to anyone looking for someone to care for their child.",

Deserie has been great from the start, she connected well with my daughter and myself and has helped me being a first time mom. Deserie is always early for work, ready to jump into care, she also helped keep my daughters nursery clean and organized. She assisted with laundry and clean up of her room weekly. Deserie was flexible when I needed her staying late or coming early. She was available for extra work when I needed her for date night services. Deserie is very knowledgeable and brings her years of expertise to the job in ways that were helpful while never overstepping and allowing me to be the ultimate decision maker when it came to my daughters care.  My daughter has definitely thrived in her care. I 1000% recommend her and hope she can bring your family as much care and ease as she brought mine.",
