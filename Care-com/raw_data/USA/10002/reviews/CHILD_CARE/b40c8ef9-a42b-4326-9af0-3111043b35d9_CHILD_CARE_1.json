            "displayText": "It is my privilege to wholeheartedly recommend Tayler.\r\n\r\nTayler has been our family babysitter, caring for our three children (ages 5-9), for the last two and a half years. After our daughter (now age 5) was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, it was difficult to find someone we felt we could entrust her care to.  A friend of mine, who is the nurse at Tayler's school, recommended Tayler to us knowing that she was very independent in caring for her own diabetes.  Having her be able to watch all of our children and confidently care for our daughter's diabetic needs has brought a sense of normalcy back to our family and has provided my husband and I with some greatly needed nights out!\r\n\r\nOur entire family, especially our children, adores Tayler.  She always has a fun and silly way with them, connecting with each kid with their own interests.  Tayler gets them doing special crafts and activities that they get so excited about.  She handles all their routines - meal time, bedtime - which I know from experience is no easy task.  Tayler confidently takes care of our daughter's medical needs: checking her blood sugar, counting her carbs, using her pump, and treating the occasional low.  She will often check her own blood sugar at the same time, which is great for my daughter to see since she doesn't yet hang out with any other kids with diabetes. \r\n\r\nIn all our time of having Tayler work for us she has proven herself to be reliable, punctual, responsible, and very kind.  Tayler has a laid back personality that our kids are drawn to.  She's not afraid to be silly and always seems to be interested in the various things my kids want to share with her.  She knows just how to interact with both our energetic little ones and our trying-to-be-cool 9 year old.  \r\n\r\nHaving Tayler in our lives has been an absolute blessing.  Tayler has been a great role model for our daughter and has had a huge positive impact on how she views herself and her diabetes.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nHeather K.",
