            "originalText": "Caroline was an excellent babysitter we would definitely hire again. Caroline watched our 4mo (\"A\") while we attended a wedding -- and she was our first non-family babysitter for A since he was born. She was communicative leading up to the job, and very punctual. We asked her to meet A a week ahead of the job to get to know him and he instantly took to her -- it was easy to tell that she had experience with babies (and kids of all ages). As we explained A's routine Caroline was very receptive and asked all of the right questions, but we could also tell that she knew a LOT and that A would be in very good hands. We are very grateful that Caroline babysat for us and look forward to working with her again. ",
