She is a delightful and talented person, and an incredibly caring, creative, and resourceful caregiver for children! We have found her to be reliable, communicative, respectful, and tactful. She demonstrates good judgment and attention to detail about our children's needs. Our children absolutely adore her and become deeply engrossed in imaginative play with her. She is an incredible artist and has greatly enhanced their enjoyment and appreciation of art. I give her credit for helping them to build a sense of humor as well! Devin is a very special person and we are lucky to have found her!",
