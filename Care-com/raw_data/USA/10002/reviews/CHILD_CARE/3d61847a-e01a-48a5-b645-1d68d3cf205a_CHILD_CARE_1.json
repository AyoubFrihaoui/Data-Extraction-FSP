            "originalText": "Benedicta (Jen) has been a wonderful nanny for my daughter Whitney and my son Jack for over the last 6 years. We were lucky enough to connect with Jenn through a friend in the neighborhood and she’s been a part of our family since my daughter was born in 2016. Jenn has over 30 years of childcare experience working with children of all ages both in a group setting and as a nanny across several Brooklyn neighborhoods. She’s also a mother of 5, and has been around young children her whole life.  Over the last 6 years, Jenn has been in our children’s lives in some capacity.  She was my daughters nanny from birth until she first attended school.  When my son was born in 2019, she took care of him and coordinated pickup with my daughter after school.  As a nanny she is incredibly reliable and flexible.  My wife’s job can be unpredictable and Jenn was always willing to work with us when curveballs were thrown our way.  Our children were always well fed, and the house was always immaculate.  She made friends with other nanny’s in the neighborhood, and through her network our children have made lifelong friends.  Jenn did a great job of nurturing our children but also was stern when the situation was warranted.  My children are very well mannered and sweet because of their experience with her.  Now that my son will be attending full day Pre-K, we unfortunately can no longer employ her full time.  Please contact myself or my wife at any time and we can answer any questions you may have.  We are so grateful that she has been a part of our lives for the past 6 years,  we just hope that we can find her another family that will be just as lucky as we were. \n\n",
