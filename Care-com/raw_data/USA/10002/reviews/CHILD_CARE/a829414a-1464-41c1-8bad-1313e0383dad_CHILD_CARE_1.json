She lived in our home five days a  week and went home on weekends.  Rhonda was both firm and nurturing at the same time.  She always kept our kids active, finding other children in the neighborhood and setting up play dates with other parents or babysitters.  Whenever the weather was good, she had the kids outside and became another member of the neighborhood.  She worked with us for four years until the kids both started going to school full time although she remains a friend of ours for life.",
