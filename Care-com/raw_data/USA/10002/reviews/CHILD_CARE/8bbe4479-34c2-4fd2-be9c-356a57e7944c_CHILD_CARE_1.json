She helped him with his neck control, taught him how to sit up, facilitated his solid foods introductions and so much more during that vital developmental age. She was amazing about taking him out everyday for a walk or activity. She even would find different activities in the neighborhood for she and our son to partake in including Liberty science Center, music sessions at the library and fostering relationships for playdates. She was always prompt and on time, and always dependable. Her communication made us feel comfortable on a daily basis. We would highly recommend Luz to any family looking for a long-term independable caretaker. You won't regret it!",
