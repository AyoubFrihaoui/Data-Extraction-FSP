            "originalText": "Mynette is truly a professional, experienced, and skilled caregiver. She took care of my infant twins for six months. Mynette was always looking out for their best interest, even if it wasn’t easy. For example, she made sure the twins got plenty of tummy time and played with them (instead of taking the easy road and just having them sleep all day).  Her diaper changing skills her perfect and she helped heal a rash that one of them had before she started. Mynette also helped me put the twins on a schedule when she saw I was having a hard time managing them. Her experience really shines when you see her at work and everything looks so easy for her.  Playing, napping, feeding, bathing them effortlessly and lovingly. And at the end of the day I would get back happy little babies who had full days and thus slept well at night. She’s also very punctual and communicative! ",
