Her and I worked together at our international school's Early Childhood Center in Switzerland and all the kids loved her because she is really sweet and very creative so she kept all the kids very engaged. Specifically, Nicole loves to draw, paint and solve puzzles (even maths puzzles!) in her free time. Nicole will be the babysitter that keeps your children away from their screens and who will leave them eager for her to come back to play with them.",
