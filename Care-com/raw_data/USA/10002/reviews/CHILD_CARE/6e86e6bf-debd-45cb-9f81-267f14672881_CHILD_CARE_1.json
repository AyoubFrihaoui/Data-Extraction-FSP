Sally is bright, responsible, and affectionate. She truly has a natural affinity toward children; our twins  faces simply lit up when she entered the room. When Sally started with our family, she had ample childcare experience but not with twins. We were impressed with how quickly she adapted and partnered with us in keeping them on the same schedule and expertly navigating the transition from infancy to toddlerhood. Our twins thrived in Sally's care. She worked tirelessly to help our children reach their developmental milestones, from physical skills like sitting and walking, to actively encouraging their lingual skills. Music and dance, reading and coloring, were all daily activities in our household. We feel fortunate to have had Sally in our home and have no doubt that she will be an asset to the next family with which she works.",
