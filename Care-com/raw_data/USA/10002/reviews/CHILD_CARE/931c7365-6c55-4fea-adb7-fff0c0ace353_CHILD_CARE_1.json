She tutored my daughter in ELA and helped improve her scores, but also made my daughter look forward to her tutoring sessions! Preethi is such a positive, helpful, and caring, individual. We also hired her as a part-time babysitter because she got along with my daughter so well. She helped around the house, took my kids to the park, and helped with my personal errands and tasks. I 100% recommend her for any job position you are looking to hire her for.",
