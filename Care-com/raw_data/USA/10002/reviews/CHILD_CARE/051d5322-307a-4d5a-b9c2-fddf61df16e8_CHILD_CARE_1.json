She was responsible, timely, kept the house tidy, and most importantly was obsessed with caring for and showing love for our two kids.   If you are looking for your kids to be outside a lot in cold weather, would recommend communicating with her on that prior to.  She worked with us on our complicated work schedule (was very flexible) and was a strong communicator.    We appreciate her clear knowledge on infants and how she developed creative activities that kept our 3 yr old engaged.",
