Maui took our daughter to the park to play, did lots of music and dancing with her, fed her meals, and cleaned up during our daughter's naps. Maui is responsible, was always on-time, and communicated well with us. She was flexible to work days around our schedules and some nights so we could go out. She is a trained dancer who was active and matched our daughter's energy and activity. Maui was also nurturing and good at calming down our daughter when needed. They formed a really strong bond and our daughter always got excited when Maui walked in. The house, and neighborhood, were full of laughter and joy. We give Maui our highest recommendation! We would keep working with Maui long-term if we were not moving out of state. Whoever works with Maui next will be lucky and their child(ren) will benefit.",

She showed up on time, even early to have a chat before starting. She fit right in,  interacting with my girls right away, and they loved her.  She's warm, and caring, and I can see her years of experience teaching when I saw her with the girls. So grateful we found her.",
