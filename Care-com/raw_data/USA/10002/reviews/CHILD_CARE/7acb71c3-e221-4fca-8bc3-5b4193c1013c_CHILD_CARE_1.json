Before bed they read books and, because Victoria is bilingual, our daughter had the opportunity to hear some of her books in Spanish. Since we were staying at a hotel, our daughter had been struggling to get to sleep, but despite the unfamiliar space, Victoria got her to bed with ease and she slept through the night. I would highly recommend Victoria to any parents in need of a babysitter.",
