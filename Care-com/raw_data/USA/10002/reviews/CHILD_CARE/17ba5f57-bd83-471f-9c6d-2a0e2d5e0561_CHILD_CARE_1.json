As a native Chinese speaker (Cantonese and Mandarin,) she primarily speak to my kids in Cantonese at our request. She also is fluent in English and easily communicates with non-Chinese speakers. My kids always look forward to seeing her. Baby N. is too young to speak, but she always smiles when she sees Nancy and my son sometimes doesn't want her to go home.\r\n \r\nWhen she first started, N. refused taking the bottle, and now she only takes the bottle from Nancy, not even my husband or her grandparents.\r\n \r\nNancy is comfortable working with children of various ages, from newborns to preschooler. She treats our kids like her own. She has two sons herself, which speaks a lot of her own experience.",
