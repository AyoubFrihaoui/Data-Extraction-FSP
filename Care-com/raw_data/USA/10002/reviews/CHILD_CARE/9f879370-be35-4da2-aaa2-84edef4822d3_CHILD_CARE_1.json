            "displayText": "Makini has been working with our family since last fall. We hired her to care for our 3 children, who are 6, 4, and 2 years old. She is extremely dependable and wonderful with our kids. She is always patient and caring. She is extremely communicative about what she is up to with the kids, sending my updates and pictures throughout the day. I never worry about what they are doing or where they are. She helps with pick-ups, managing multiple schedules, nap times, bath times, meal times, snacks, in addition to helping with the kids' laundry. I appreciate that she loves to take the kids outside and she has comfort with many of the playgrounds and parks in our neighborhood. She has fostered connections for our kids with other neighborhood children. She stayed with our kids overnight when my husband and I had to travel at the same time for work. We have been lucky to have her in our life. I am happy to speak with anyone who is considering Makini as a nanny.",
