            "displayText": "Corinne is a warm, loving, and sweet caretaker who cared for our 1 year old son regularly until unfortunately our needs changed and we required a schedule that did not fit hers. We regret very much that we are not be able to work with her anymore. \r\n\r\nOne aspect of Corinne is the responsible, competent and mature side of her personality. She made it to work early even when trains were delayed. She's a sharp person who picked up our routine easily. She got all of her responsibilities done and did not make any slip ups with us during her time here.\r\n\r\nWhen interacting with our son she was very engaging and spoke to and played with him throughout the day. Our son had delays when it came to crawling, so she physically moved with him as we requested. He warmed up to her very quickly and they did not have any conflict interacting.\r\n\r\nCorinne, I wish you the best and I hope you find a better match! It was lovely to meet you and I hope there will be an opportunity for us to meet again.",
