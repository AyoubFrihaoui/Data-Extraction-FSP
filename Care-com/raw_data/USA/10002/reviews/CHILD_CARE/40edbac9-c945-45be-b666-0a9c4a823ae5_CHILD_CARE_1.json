            "originalText": "We've had many nannies over the years through moves and circumstances, and I can safely say that Johanny is the best nanny we've had by far! Johanny cared for our 2 boys (now 4.5 and 3 yo) every Friday and Saturday afternoons/nights for the past 3 years, and we'd have loved for her to continue for many more years had we not moved out of NY recently.\n\nJohanny is loving, patient, kind, responsible, smart and giving. She is well-versed on child development, always seeing the \"good inside\" of our boys, even when they're having tantrums. She knows how to be playful yet firm, and she's always safe - I can leave my boys with her knowing that they're in very good hands across all areas (feeding, values, safety, reliability of attending their classes, sleeping on time etc). \n\nShe's very professional and reliable, always looking to see how she can help us when we need additional childcare support during the week, or just offering to bring dinner for the boys to lessen our workload. I can tell that she genuinely loves and cares for the boys, and over the years we've come to see her as part of our family as well. She also never asks us for much (even for this review, I wrote it without her ever asking bc she's so deserving) but gives us so much.\n\nShe's amazing and seriously any family would be so lucky to have her. Highly recommend. All of us miss her dearly!",
