It was our first time leaving our son with someone both he and we didn't know. She came in and I immediately felt my shoulders relax. She has such a lovely, kind, soft, happy way - she allowed our son time to get comfortable, and she even brought her own little finger puppets to help play and build trust with him. She is also a DO-ER! That first day she took him out to a class he was signed up for - new kid, new neighborhood, new class, no problem. She handled it all with ease and care. She sent pictures throughout the day and was perfectly communicative. She came for three days in a row, it was wonderful and I felt (and clearly still feel!) so grateful.",
