            "originalText": "Zay has been our after school sitter for almost 2 years now.  Zay is amazing--friendly, responsible (never late, never sick), very calm, caring, clean (straightens up, takes out trash, doesn't leave dishes in the sink), my kids' love him.  He exceeded our expectations in any task we gave him for the kids.  He picked our kids up from school and took them home on the subway, made sure they did their homework (and helped them, particularly our youngest if they needed it), showered, practiced piano, etc.  He took them to their after school activities.  Zay did the kids' laundry (which was an expectation of the job).  We also had Zay drive the kids a few times (he seems like an excellent driver).  Zay is fit and athletic (he has a college degree in sports education, was a football player).  He took our kids to the park and he helped teach our youngest to ride a bike.  Zay has become like a family member (we've met his lovely fianc√©, and his adorable nephew) to us and we highly recommend him.  Additionally, I called and talk to his reference before he started the job who all highly recommended him. ",
