She started caring for our son when he was 4 months old and he adores spending time with her. They developed a very special bond and I know she genuinely cares for him, showing him so much love and affection. She has a lot of experience and is a mom herself, so she often gave us excellent advice and comfort to us as new parents. My husband and I have been working from home and we were able to focus comfortably knowing our son was in caring hands, laughing and learning with her.  I would highly recommend Jessica to anyone looking for a kind, helpful, intelligent nanny for their child. She's the best and we will miss her!",

I highly recommend her. She worked for my family for 2 years. She is very loving and trustworthy and always punctual! Our needs have changed so unfortunately we no longer needed her services but if you are looking for a excellent nanny you have found her! Thank you.",
