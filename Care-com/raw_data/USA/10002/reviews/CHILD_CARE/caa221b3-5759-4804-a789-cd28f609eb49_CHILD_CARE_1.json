She is all the things we hoped for - responsible, reliable, caring, patient, active, and creative. She brought all her early-development experience into our home by reading to our son, singing songs, practicing flash-cards and puzzles with him, going to the library, and encouraging group play and socializing at the playground. She helped us get him completely out of diapers, exercised his fine motor skills (puzzles, using utensils and scissors correctly, holding crayons, etc.), and made cleaning up a fun part of his daily routine. I work from home and never had any interruptions or came downstairs to find her distracted or our son sitting in front of the TV. \n\nShe has truly been our Mary Poppins and brought calm happiness to our home!\n\nI can’t recommend Jessica more strongly – we love her like a member of the family.",
