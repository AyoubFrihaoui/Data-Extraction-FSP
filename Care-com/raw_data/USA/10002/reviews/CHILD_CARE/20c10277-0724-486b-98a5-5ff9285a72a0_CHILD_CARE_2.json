She genuinely loves kids and actually plays with my daughter (reading books, singing songs, playing with rattles & other toys, talking to her) as opposed to just sticking her in the swing & watching tv the whole time as other babysitters may be inclined to do with an infant. She is very flexible with her hours\r\nwhich I appreciate, and she's always shown up on time or else early. I would definitely recommend her to other parents.",
