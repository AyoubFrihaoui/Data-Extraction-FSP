She picked our daughter up from the camp bus, our son from day care and then took amazing care of them until we came up home working quite late. She also helped during some mornings. She was not only 100% reliable, but also very flexible and stayed with us (very) late, while I got stuck on  business trips. It is a great feeling to come home to fed, clean and bed-ready kids, but even more importantly, they also love her. When you work with Janeen, you'll feel her passion for kids. I fully trust her with my children would recommend Janeen to anybody who needs help!",
