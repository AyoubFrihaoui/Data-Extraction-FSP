            "originalText": "Marley adored our infant son and he thrived under her care while she helped us this past summer. She also watched both our children on a few occasions and was quite sweet and engaging with our toddler as well. She was going through a rough patch family and transportation-wise that impeded morning timeliness/arrival in a few instances, but was overall quite communicative and responsible if anything came up that she had to deal with. We would absolutely hire her again without any hesitation: her warmth and loving care was so apparent in how happy our little one was when he would spend time with her!",
