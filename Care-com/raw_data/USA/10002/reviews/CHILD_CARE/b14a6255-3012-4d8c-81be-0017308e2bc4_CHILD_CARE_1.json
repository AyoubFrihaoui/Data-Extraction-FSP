She was incredibly reliable, arriving on time and adhering to our routines and guidelines with ease. My child felt comfortable and at ease with Zynai, and it was clear that she genuinely cares about his well-being. She engaged him with creative activities and ensured that my son had a fun and safe time. I would highly recommend Zynai to anyone in need of a trustworthy and attentive babysitter. I look forward to working with her again!",
