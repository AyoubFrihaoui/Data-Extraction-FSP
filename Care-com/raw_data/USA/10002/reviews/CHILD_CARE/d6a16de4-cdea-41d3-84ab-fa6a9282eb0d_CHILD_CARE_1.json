Because I work in the place where he volunteers, I hear from these youth often about how much they appreciate Rene. His consistency, warmth, and openness make young people feel safe and understood. He is dependable and kind, and takes the time to build authentic, secure relationships. He is also creative and a lot of fun! He'd be a great fit for kids who love music, being active, and getting outside.",
