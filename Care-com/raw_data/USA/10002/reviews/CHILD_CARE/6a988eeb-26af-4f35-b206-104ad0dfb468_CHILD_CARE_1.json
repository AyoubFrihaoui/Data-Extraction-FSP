My baby is typically defensive to new people but Awa has her special approach to quickly click with her.\n\nThroughout the day, Awa was able to take care of my baby independently (and happily) without too much intervention from us.\n\nWe can tell Awa likes baby from inside so would recommend her to anyone needs a good babysitter like her.",
