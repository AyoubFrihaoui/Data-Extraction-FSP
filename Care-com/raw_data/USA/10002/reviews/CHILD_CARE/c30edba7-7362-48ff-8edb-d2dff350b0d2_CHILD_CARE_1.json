            "originalText": "Our family has been extremely fortunate to have Chavi as our nanny to our two young boys, ages one and three. We hired Chavi well over a year ago and she quickly established herself as an extension of our family.\n\nChavi is exceptionally dedicated, reliable, attentive and patient and I have always felt exceedingly comfortable with Chavi as our nanny. She has a warm and special connection with each of our sons, and it has been a pleasure to see their relationships develop and evolve. \n\nChavi takes excellent initiative, seeking to be proactive and thoughtful with her suggestions for our family on a daily basis. She also works hard to instill consistent daily routines, emotional well-being, and thoughtfulness (particularly in our oldest son).\n\nAfter our second son was born, Chavi stepped in after my first few months of maternity leave and helped me handle the various challenges of the newborn stage. She manages very well with both of our sons, attending to each of their needs in an effective and calm manner. \n\nWe will certainly miss having Chavi as our nanny and we would have absolutely  continued our time with her if not for our upcoming move out of state. She is truly reliable and exceptional and I believe that her next family will value her just as much as we have. ",
