It was our first time using a sitter and Rebecca was kind enough to FaceTime with us ahead of time to learn more about our daughter and make us feel comfortable. We especially appreciated how responsive she was and that she shared her location and sent tons of photos when taking her out for walks. Definitely would hire her again. ",
