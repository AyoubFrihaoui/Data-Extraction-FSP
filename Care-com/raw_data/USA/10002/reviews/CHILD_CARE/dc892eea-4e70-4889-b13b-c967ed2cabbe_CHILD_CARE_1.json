She truly loved our boys ( 9 months and 3and a half years old)  in such a way that I am sure they will never forget her! She is one of the kindest people I had the chance to meet. She is very punctual, patient, calm, smart, switched on, flexible, helpful and so carrying! Her experience is great, she is confident and knowledgeable. Adiaha played with my kids, while also educating them when needing and always teaching them new things! She constantly found ways of showing them how to be more independent , teaching them new words, showing them how to be kind and polite. She never had an issue to stay with both of them at the same time, although they are very energetic and active. I feel they were always safe with her. She brought sunshine in their lives and I will always thank her for loving them the way she did, and still does, I'm sure :)",
