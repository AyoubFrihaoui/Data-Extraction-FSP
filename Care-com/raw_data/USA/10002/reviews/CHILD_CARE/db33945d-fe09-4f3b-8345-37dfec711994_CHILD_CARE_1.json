            "displayText": "Cheryl is like my second mother. I probably talk to her more than I talk to my actual mom. She helped raised me and my 3 other siblings since the moment we were born. I am now a smart 22 year-old finishing my degrees in Psychology and Anthropology. She is caring and super responsible. She is fun as well as strict when she has to be. GREAT COOK! I'd cry as a kid sometimes when she would go home cause that's how much I loved my babysitter. If you don't hire her, you are making a mistake. There's no one better I'd my life and any kids' lives with. \r\n\r\nShe also has experience with senior care, and twins. If you have any questions about her, feel free to call me.\r\nSHE'S AMAZING.",
