She is so caring, gentle, respectful and knowledgeable for caring for babies and older kids. We also have an 8 year old that she played with when he was out of school. She really is an angel and I miss her! Laura has wonderful communication skills and is extremely dependable. I would re-hire her in a heartbeat if we ever had another child. She still babysits for us when we need care. Highly recommend her for any childcare!",

She sang to him, read him books,\r\nhelped him with tummy time, took him on walks, spoke to him in both English and Spanish, the\r\nlist goes on and on! One day, she walked to the library with our son and found a Baby Story\r\nTime that she planned to take him to weekly.
