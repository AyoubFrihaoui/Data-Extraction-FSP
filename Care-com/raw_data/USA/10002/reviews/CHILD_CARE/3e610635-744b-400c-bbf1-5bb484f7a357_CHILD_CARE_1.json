Kimmie began with us when our first daughter was an infant in 2001, and stayed she with us for 5 years caring for our two daughters. She lived in our home for two of those years. Kimmie was an outstanding child care provider. She is highly competent and an independent thinker requiring very little \"instruction\" or guidance. She is very responsive to requests and always engaged the girls in fun, educational activities. Her background in education was also very apparent as she started teaching our girls to read when they were very young.  Our children loved her.  Kimmie has an abundance of childcare experience from infant through older children and she takes great pride in her career as a nanny. Any family would be lucky to have her. We have continued to maintain a very close relationship with her over the years and consider her a family member. It is without hesitation that we recommend her.",
