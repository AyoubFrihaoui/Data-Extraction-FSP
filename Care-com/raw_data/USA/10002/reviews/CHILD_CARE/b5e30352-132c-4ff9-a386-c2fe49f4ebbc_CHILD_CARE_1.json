She’s also great about responding to messages and communication, as well as letting us know anything pertinent going on during the babysitting.  Perhaps even more importantly, she is great at playing with and having fun with the kids she is taking care of!  Our 4-year-old daughter tremendously enjoys having Chelsea come over to have fun with her when we go out, both in our apartment and in our building’s playroom.  Chelsea’s theater background also comes in handy as our daughter loves singing and dancing around in our apartment, and Chelsea will join right in with her.  We’re always glad to have Chelsea babysit for our family!\n",
