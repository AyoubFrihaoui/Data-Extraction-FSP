            "displayText": "Francesca was our after-school babysitter for a year and a half. We have twins - my son who has autism and my daughter who does not - and she was so good at managing both of them simultaneously. \r\n\r\nFrancesca recently completed her MA at NYU, where she was studying Opera singing. Her talent is not just in singing however - I have learned that she was an art minor as an undergrad, and she does these fabulously creative things with my kids. For example, my daughter often writes a story and then makes Francesca illustrate it - and they make gorgeous books together! One day I came home and found that she had fashioned rounded helmets out of Freshdirect boxes for the kids so they could pretend that they were in outer space. (They were round, I tell you! I have no idea how she did it!) She is great at balancing my two kids' very different needs and wants. She will draw with my daughter but then do shadow puppets with my son. She will get them both involved with a obstacle course that runs through our house. They will have a bubble dance party at a moments notice. Endlessly creative and fun to be around... but also responsible and trustworthy.\r\n\r\nWhat makes Francesca extra-special is that she was SO good with my autistic son. (This is a rarity among caregivers!) In other words, with every quirky thing that my son does, she was not bothered in the least by. She \"gets it.\" She is not shocked or terrified by anything. \r\n\r\nDo not hesitate to meet Francesca and judge her skills for yourself. You won't be disappointed.",
