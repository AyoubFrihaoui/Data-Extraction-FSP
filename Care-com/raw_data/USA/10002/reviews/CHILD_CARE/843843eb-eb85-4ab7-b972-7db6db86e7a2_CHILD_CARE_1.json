She is proactive about finding activities and making play dates with other kids and nannies. She takes every opportunity to teach letters, numbers and new words while working on gross and fine motor skills. She is completely trustworthy - she has stayed with our son for weeks while my partner and I went on our honeymoon and multiple weekends while we've had work travel. \r\nAlicia has become like a family member to us and, unfortunately, we are moving out of state and she is unable to join us.
