Brittanie was outstanding in her care of him and even though we had previously never left him with anyone who wasn't family, we instantly felt at ease with Brittanie.  \r\n\r\nShe is honest, caring and affectionate with our baby, very capable in terms of administering proper care for a baby who was teething and then experiencing a bad cold.  \r\n\r\nThe other great thing about Brittanie is that she is very easy to deal with.  She is a very good communicator as well as being punctual and proactive.\r\n\r\nIf you are fortunate enough to have Brittanie care for your children, I am sure you will be very happy with the experience.",
