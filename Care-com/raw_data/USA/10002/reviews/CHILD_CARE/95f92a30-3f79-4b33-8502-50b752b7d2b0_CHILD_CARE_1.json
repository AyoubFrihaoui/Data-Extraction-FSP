            "displayText": "Abigail has been the ideal babysitter for our daughter. Professionally, she is always punctual and a great communicator, letting us know well in advance of any scheduling changes. As a caretaker, she has been absolutely wonderful. From the start, she has spent quality time with our daughter, meeting her needs and interests as they developed over the course of her babysitting. We felt confident letting Abigail take our daughter for walks around the neighborhood in the warm weather. Indoors, she's fostered new interests with our daughter, reading dozens (maybe hundreds) of books, helping her learn to draw, teaching colors, and so much more. She has always not just \"watched\" our daughter, but actively engaged with her at all times. She has also been comfortable following our approach to childcare, which allows a great deal of independence. Our daughter adores Abigail, who she calls \"Gabba,\" and we will all miss her so much. I highly recommend Abigail to other families and parents!",
