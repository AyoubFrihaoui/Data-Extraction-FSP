            "displayText": "Galyna has been with us since our son was 1 month up until now (he is 3). She started on a part time basis and then went to full time after i went back to work when he was only 3 months old. Over the last 3 years, she has really become family to us and the only reason why we are parting is because we moved too far. \r\nOur son is growing up to be an amazing little human being and i credit a lot of it to Galyna. From the day she started, she treated him as a little person, spoke with him constantly and made sure that he was her focus. On nice days he was outside most of the time. Fresh air and attention is what the little ones need. As he got older, Galyna spent time reading, teaching him letters, words, numbers and as his mobility increased, made sure that he got plenty of run time to get him tired. She cares for him like he is her own. \r\nGalyna is the most dependable person I know. While I, my husband and Max have had sick days in the last 3 years, I can't remember a day when Galyna got sick! She accommodated when we would get stuck late at work and more or less kept our life on track. \r\nAny home that Galyna will end up working with will be blessed with a loving, caring, attentive, dependable, full of life and trustworthy person who will inevitably earn a warm place in your heart. \r\nIt really is heart breaking to say good bey and the only reason why we are is geographical. I'm happy to speak to anyone who is thinking of working with Galyna.",
