Laura has also helped her to develop social skills and make friends at the park. She is proactive, reliable, and supportive. \n\nAs a working mom, I have never once worried about my daughter's well-being while I am at work and she is with Laura.\n\nIn short, Laura is the perfect nanny. We would have loved to keep working with her forever, but unfortunately are moving out of state. We even offered to pay for her move but she is staying in New York for personal reasons. She is the absolute best and any family would be lucky to have her. ",
