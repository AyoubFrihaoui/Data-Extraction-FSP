From the moment she joined our family, she brought a level of expertise, warmth, and dedication that completely exceeded our expectations.\n\nCaring for twins is no easy task, but Antonique handled everything with incredible patience, organization, and love. She established and maintained a structured sleep and feeding schedule, which was a game-changer for our household. Her knowledge of infant development ensured that our babies were constantly engaged in age-appropriate activities that supported their growth and milestones.\n\nOne of the things we appreciated most was her unwavering commitment to safety. She was always attentive, followed safe sleep guidelines, and ensured a clean and secure environment for our little ones. Whether it was tummy time, soothing techniques, or gently encouraging independent sleep habits, she always had our babiesâ€™ well-being as her top priority.\n\nBeyond her skills, Antonique became an invaluable part of our family. She not only supported our twins but also gave us, as parents, peace of mind and confidence. Her warmth, professionalism, and genuine love for children make her truly exceptional. Any family would be lucky to have her!",
