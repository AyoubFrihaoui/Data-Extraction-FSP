Despite my warnings, Jackie wasn’t phased a bit and she was right — she handled them like a champ. Day 1 they were out and about all day - the museum, picnic in the park, etc and the girls had the best time! There was even crying for her when she left!\n\nIn addition to showing them a great day, Jackie was prepared, on time, and communicative before, during and even after her visit. Our little one is still in diapers and Jackie was on top of it. Truly a parent’s dream for a sitter. Can’t say enough great things and we’ll definitely have her back!",
