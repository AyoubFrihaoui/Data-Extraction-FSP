            "displayText": "We hired Carrie to pick up our two daughters (11 and 7) from two different schools, bring them home, and prepare dinner for them and my father. She worked with us for the full school year. During that time, she was literally never late once. I am not always on top of the school schedule (breaks, days off), but I had given Carrie the school calendar at the beginning of the year so she would often remind me when they had a day off, etc. And if there was a last minute change (kids returning late from a school trip, etc), she was very flexible and always accommodated us. She is very concerned about safety, enforced 'street crossing' and phone-use-while-walking rules that we had set up. She's also very sweet. My younger daughter is taking ballet lessons, so Carrie taught her how to practice her splits and other moves. I'm a big fan and highly recommend her! ",
