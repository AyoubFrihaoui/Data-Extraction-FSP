She is truly gifted at caregiving and forming a social/emotional connection with each child in her care. She can play chess with our 7yo, rock out to Taylor Swift with our 4yo, and build playdoh with our 2yo. She knows how to structure the day around kid schedules, and is a terrific driver. Any family looking for an energetic, skilled, and loving nanny would be lucky to have June on their team.",
