My family and I love to joke and make each other laugh because our children keep us happy. She is very open minded and outgoing. My first thought was that she sounds like she has a great attitude and enjoys being with children. I would totally recommend Melissa to care for your children.  I know my children will be taken care of.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\nAmber",
