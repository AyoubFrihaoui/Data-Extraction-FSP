It was our first time using someone that was not our regular nanny as a babysitter and she was amazing. She put our minds at ease right away and was great with the kids.  They warmed up to her right away. She kept us updated throughout the night on how the kids were doing, which was greatly appreciated. She got the kids to bed on time and the kids enjoyed having her as their babysitter. We will definitely use her again in the future.",
