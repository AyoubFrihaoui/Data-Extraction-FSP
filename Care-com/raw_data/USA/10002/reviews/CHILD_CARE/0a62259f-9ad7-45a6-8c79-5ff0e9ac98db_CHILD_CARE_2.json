            "displayText": "We hired Madalyn (Maddy) in August 2018 after very positive communications with her and her references. We scheduled nearly 40 hours of work with her for early September and confirmed daily part-time work would take place thru June 2019. Three days before her first shift Maddy texted me to say she was canceling two days of work with us to babysit for another family. Maddy made no effort to consult us about this decision nor apologize until we expressed surprise and disappointment at her behavior. Within two hours she had texted me again to cancel the entirety of her commitment to working with our family, explaining that she was not in a position to take on a second job. We found Maddy's actions to be incredibly unprofessional and immature, given her enthusiasm and definitive commitment to caring for our son, mere days before this incident. We strongly caution families to weigh the hardship of finding a \"great\" sitter only to have them cancel so disrespectfully before hiring Madalyn. ",

We got her contact info from our very close friends who said Madalyn had cared for her kids back when they were babies and she was great. We live in dumbo Brooklyn and we had traveled to the city for our date- night. Maddy also stayed extra time due to traffic and we got home a little later then we anticipated. Maddy took our girls out to the playground which is blocks from our home. She also feed and bathe them. Plus washed their hair which they would never let me do.

So of course we called her last minute and she came through for us. She stood with A. for about 6 hours longer then we expected but she didn't mind staying late. She cleaned our home and made sure our little one was feed and put to bed at her  schedule time which was amazing.

Always makes my children happy and that makes me really happy. She always asks questions which I like. Keeps me updated on my child's potty breaks and naps.
