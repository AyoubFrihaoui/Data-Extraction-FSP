Fortunately Vivian responded back to my job post very early in the morning and was at my place in next 15 minutes - I hired a cab for her to be at my place quickly but she did all she could to start in next 5 minutes to be at my place considering the emergency situation I had to take care of, not eating her breakfast, leaving everything else behind. I appreciate her understanding and willingness so much to help me be with the unexpected bad situation before extremely important appointment in next one hour. Cannot thank her enough for understanding my panic. She was very pleasant and willing to help with whatever I needed help with. My son loved spending time with her. \r\n\r\nI recommend her very strongly and will hire her again!!!",
