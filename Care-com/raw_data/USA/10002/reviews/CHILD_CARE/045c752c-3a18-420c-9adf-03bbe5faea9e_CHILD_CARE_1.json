Hayley is reliable, trustworthy, extremely caring and competent. It should be noted that Hayley has a big personality and fantastic sense of humor. This was great for my dad who was quick witted and playful. Hayley worked collaboratively with all our other caregivers and our family. She was respectful (always) of everyone's needs. She was a joy to have in the house during a very difficult time.",

Hayley became a member of our family, and always acted in my mother's best interests.\r\n\r\nShe was always dependable, diligent and honest, and displayed unbelievable patience with an often difficult client. \r\n\r\nHayley provided an extensive array of services, including cooking, light housekeeping, shopping, and personal care. She did all that was requested or needed, and more, and did it all well. \r\n\r\nMy mother's quality of life and independence was greatly improved and enhanced by Hayley, and she was able to live independently until her recent death at almost 100 years old.\r\n\r\nOur family will always be grateful to Hayley's for her care and love of our mother.",
