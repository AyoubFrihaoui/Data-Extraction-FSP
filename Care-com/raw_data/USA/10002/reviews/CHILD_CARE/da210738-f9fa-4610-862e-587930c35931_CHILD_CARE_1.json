She started caring for my son when he was five months old; he'll be three next month. \n\nI cannot fully express how lucky I feel that Euri is a major part of our family's life. As I said before, she is absolutely wonderful with my son—patient, kind, generous, creative, silly, and active. She is so skilled at connecting with and managing small kids, and I'm constantly in awe of how thoughtful, capable, and unflappable she is. When she and my son are together, I have zero worries, which feels like a gift. \n\nThere’s no doubt in my mind that Euri has been (and continues to be) a pivotal influence in my son’s young life. He adores her, has learned and explored so much thanks to her. And she has contributed greatly to his development of healthy, secure attachments. \n\nEuri is dependable, and a great communicator. She is what any parent would want for their child—a loving caregiver who is also totally in charge. \n\nTruly, any family would be lucky to work with Euri!",

She is a kind, caring, reliable and highly experienced caregiver for children of all ages, from infants to school age. \n\nWe first met Ms E (as we call her) as a teacher in my daughter’s daycare, where she worked in the toddler and infant classrooms. At the start of the pandemic, Ms E babysat for our daughter (who was almost 2 at the time) for several months while the daycare was closed. Ms E was very proactive and creative in coming up with activities to do with our daughter despite the many limitations at the time. She set up art projects (which we still have displayed in our daughter’s room four years later!), brought us books, researched local parks to take my daughter to, and began potty-training with her. My husband and I will be forever grateful to Ms E for how much she helped our family during this challenging time.\n\nSince then, we have continued to use Ms E as a babysitter for evenings, weekends, and days off of school (including half days when she does pick up). She regularly watches my daughter, now close to 6, and my son, who is almost 2 and whom she has babysat since he was a baby. Last year, she helped my mother to watch the kids when my husband and I were out of town - we couldn’t have done those trips without her! We feel very fortunate to have a caregiver like Ms E in our lives. ",
