She's worked with us for 10 months and it's been a pleasure and relief to have her consistent help on weekends. Mariah is a warm and responsible babysitter who is very safety-minded, she engages both boys in conversation, arts and crafts projects and games. She is incredibly patient, calm and consistent and doesn't get frazzled one bit even when both boys are wild with extra bursts of energy and/or loud with frustration. She's a great role model for them and she meets the boys on their level of play and conversation. She also helps with preparing meals, transportation, and bathing. She still works with us and hope that continues for a long time!",
