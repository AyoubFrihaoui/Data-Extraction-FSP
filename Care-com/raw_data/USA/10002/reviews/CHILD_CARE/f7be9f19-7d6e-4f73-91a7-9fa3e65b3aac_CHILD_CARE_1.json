Siham was reliable, caring, and attentive, creating a nurturing and safe environment that helped our child thrive.\n\nOur toddler quickly bonded with her, and it was clear that she genuinely cared for our child’s well-being. Siham was always patient, kind, and engaging, keeping our little one entertained with creative and educational activities that fostered both learning and fun. She was also punctual and respectful of our home.\n\nWe are grateful for her dedication and the peace of mind she provided us during the year. We highly recommend Siham to any family looking for a responsible, loving, and professional caregiver.",

We have never worried about the well being of our child while she was under Siham's care. She is gentle with her yet knows how to set boundaries, adhering to a schedule but also showing flexibility when necessary. She has also taken our child to many classes and I always trusted her opinion when it came to the best activities for her. \r\n\r\nWe haven't had one issue with her in the 2+ years we have worked with her. She is honest and communicative and we were able to figure things out as we went along when necessary.\r\n\r\nAnd she speaks fluent French which was a must for us as I wanted my daughter to speak my native tongue.\r\n\r\nWe are very sad that we will no longer need her (our daughter is going to preschool full time in the fall) and any family will be lucky to have her!",
