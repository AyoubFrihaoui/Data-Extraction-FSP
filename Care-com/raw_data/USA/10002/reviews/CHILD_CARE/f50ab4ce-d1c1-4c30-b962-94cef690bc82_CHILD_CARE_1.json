She was always dependable and would come through for us in a clutch, which happened more than you'd expect in a city like SF. The trains would break down or I'd get held up at work sometimes. Eleanor was flexible and reliable. She had a great bond with my daughter who still asks about her to this day. We loved Eleanor, any family would be lucky to have her for a sitter.",
