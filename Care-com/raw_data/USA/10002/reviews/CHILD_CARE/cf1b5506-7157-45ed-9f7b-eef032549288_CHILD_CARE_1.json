I found Jackie here on Care.com and she was just perfect.  Great experience, dependable, trustworthy, and, most importantly, warm and loving with the kids.  Both my boys loved having her babysit - she was always ready to play games, read to them, and get them outside to play.  I highly recommend her to other families looking for a top-notch babysitter or nanny.",
