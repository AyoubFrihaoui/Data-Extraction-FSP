I never felt unsafe with them in her care she would always keep me updated as-well as make sure they were fed and happy all summer. The kids all miss her and ask me to call her just to say hi all of the time I would definitely be using her in the future for any of our day care needs.  Thank you Ashley for your help this summer !",
