As a result, the pollution from a roofing project next door was coming into my apartment for over a week. I was away and, upon my return, my bathroom was filthy and I had to throw the white window shade away (since it turned gray). In addition, when I asked Nancy for ordinary cleaning and sanitation tasks, she said she could not honor those requests and would not be working for me any longer. As someone in the service business myself, I am a believer in taking good care of your clients and any reasonable requests they may have. I found Nancy unprofessional and unreliable.",
