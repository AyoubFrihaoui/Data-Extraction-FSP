Our girl was around 19 months old when we decided to move to a daycare instead and it was hard to say good by to Rocio! \r\nOur child really bonded with Rocio and it was wonderful to see them playing together, laughing, learning, running around. Rocio was dependable and responsible and we knew from the start that our child is in good hands. She is creative, fun and patient. She seems like a great teacher and was always warm and caring with our baby. We learned a lot from her also ;) She was out and about for walks and strolls every day, no matter the weather- we really like that!",
