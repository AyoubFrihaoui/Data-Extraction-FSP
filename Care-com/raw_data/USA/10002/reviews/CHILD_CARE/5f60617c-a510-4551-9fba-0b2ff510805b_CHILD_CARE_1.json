She started working for us 2 years ago when our second kid was just a few months old, and has been wonderful with both him and his older brother (now 6). Super dependable, fun to work with, the kids love her and look forward to seeing her every day. \r\n\r\nShe came referred to us with glowing recommendations and it was all spot-on. She was with our younger kid M-F 9-5, taught him how to ride a little scooter, how to use a spoon, to identify shapes, the list goes on. She has a real warmth and affection, and the kids also listen to her. She also helped out around the house, preparing delicious food, helping with laundry, picking up and teaching the kids how to pick up. She orchestrated playdates, and took our little guy to the library/parks or other events, often with other kids and nannies.\r\n\r\nWe would definitely keep working with her, but our younger kid is going to school full-time in the fall. Families: you would be really lucky to get her! She's the best!",

            "displayText": "I am pleased to give my highest recommendations to Shahara to be the caregiver for your family.  Shahara was our family's caregiver for nearly five years, and we had known her for 2 years before in her prior position with a well-regarded Manhattan daycare facility.  Shahara cared for my two boys from infancy through early childhood, and remains in close touch with them.  \r\n\r\nShahara kept my lively boys entertained, organized and loved!  She is energetic and willing to participate in many activities, including organized activities (soccer, Gymboree, etc.) but she is also well able to arrange activities for the kids herself, whether play dates, free play at home, or visiting local parks and attractions.  \r\n\r\nShe is equally at home with all ages - newborns, infants, active toddlers, and young children.  She helped my boys through numerous early childhood milestones, and independently set up a classroom area where they learned shapes, colors, numbers and the alphabet.  When the boys started school she was diligent about working with them on reading and homework.  \r\n\r\nNeedless to say, Shahara is very reliable and timely; she is flexible with her schedule, and was willing to help accommodate my job which sometimes required long hours, an early start, or an occasional overnight.\r\n\r\nPerhaps most importantly, my boys love Shahara.  They look forward to spending time with her; they miss her when they do not see her or speak with her regularly.  Even now that we have been away from the area for a year, they still look forward to speaking with her on Face Time.  \r\n\r\nShahara will be a wonderful addition to your family!",
