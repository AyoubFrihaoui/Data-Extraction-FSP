My kids loved her more than any other nanny we have had and she was always punctual and reliable. I would have kept her on for as long as possible if our situation allowed. She picked up my 7 and 4 year old after school and took them to different activities, made them food and played with them. They had a friend and a responsible adult that I fully trusted to take care of them. I would highly recommend her to anyone else.",
