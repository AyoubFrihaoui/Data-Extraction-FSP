She brought her own recipes to the job and was open to learning new ones. She has a great attitude and lots of energy and was able to adapt to what was most important to us in any given week and to the evolution of her duties as our children became older and more independent, when she helped more around the house.  Ayshia coordinated with us on vacations to align with our needs. She deserves another great family who needs help!",
