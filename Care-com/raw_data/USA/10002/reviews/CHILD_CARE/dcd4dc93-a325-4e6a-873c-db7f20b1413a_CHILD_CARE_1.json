Nata has demonstrated tremendous responsibility in taking care of our children and in keeping the kid area in working order. She is kind, trustworthy and great with children.\r\n\r\nIt is clear to me that working as a nanny is a passion for Nataliya.. She loves working with the children, and I see this manifest in her communication skills and creative ideas for activities. She keeps the children occupied and most importantly, safe.\r\n\r\nUltimately, Nataliya is an excellent nanny because she is so trustworthy. She is always on-time and held to high responsibility. My family has never known her not to be forthcoming and honest.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDiana",
