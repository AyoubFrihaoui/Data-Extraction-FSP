Our daughter is genuinely excited to see Emily (EmEmEmEm was one of her first sounds!). On top of all the books and playing and songs, Emily has taken some of the best pictures of our daughter that we have. She's done all of this while being flexible with navigating my husband and I working from home, at the same time she is here. \r\n\r\nIf our space was bigger, or my husband and I were going back into the office we would have kept Emily here in a heartbeat.
