From the very beginning, she felt like part of the family. Our kids absolutely adored her, and she created such a warm, supportive, and safe environment for them.\n\nYohannah has a special talent for connecting with children. She really got to know each of our kids and made sure to tailor activities to their interests and needs. Whether it was keeping our toddler busy with fun sensory play or planning creative crafts for our preschooler, she always made learning and playtime fun.\n\nShe’s also incredibly reliable and organized. Yohannah handled everything—meals, naps, school pickups—with ease and made our lives so much easier. On top of that, she kept the kids’ play areas and belongings tidy, which was such a bonus!\n\nWe’re so thankful for everything Yohannah has done for our family. Her kindness, patience, and genuine love for children made her such an amazing caregiver. While we’re sad to see her move on, we know she’ll be just as wonderful in her next role.\n\nIf you’re looking for a caring, dependable, and all-around fantastic nanny, we can’t recommend Yohannah enough!",
