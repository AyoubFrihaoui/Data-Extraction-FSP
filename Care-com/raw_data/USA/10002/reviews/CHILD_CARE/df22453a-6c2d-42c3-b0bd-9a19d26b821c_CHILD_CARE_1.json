And, we would have loved to have her stay with us forever had she not moved out of state. \n\nShe cared for our children as if they were her own. We trusted her completely and she deserved it. She is loyal, kind, responsible, smart, and extremely loving. Everyone in our family absolutely adores her. She has the type of character that gets along well with all different kinds of people. She formed friendships with everyone she met, and our kids benefited from that.\n\nBeyond taking care of our kids, she worked as our house manager and my assistant. She is extremely organized and resourceful. She completed projects for me and ran errands for me. She attended to all her responsibilities with calmness and grace. My house was always clean, and my kids were always happy and safe.\n\nOur life has forever been made better by our time with Marian. She will continue to stay a special part of our lives, and we will love her till the end of time! We are envious of anyone who gets her in their home next! ",
