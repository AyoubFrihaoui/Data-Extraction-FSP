Our 5 month old was a very tough baby and she was so patient and stuck with every new sleeping program we threw her way with grace. It was also during COVID, so she was home with the girls while we were working from home in a small house. She made the situation absolutely comfortable for all parties and we loved having her there. She still babysits for us and feels like a part of our family!",
