She helped us watch our 2 and 4 yr old kiddos during my sister’s wedding weekend in Brooklyn – over 30 hrs of babysitting, including coming to the wedding and helping while the kids were in the ceremony – and I couldn’t have asked for a better care giver. \n\nReliable, communicative, energetic, easy to be around, smart, kids loved her.  I only wish we could have taken her back to Colorado with us!   \n",
