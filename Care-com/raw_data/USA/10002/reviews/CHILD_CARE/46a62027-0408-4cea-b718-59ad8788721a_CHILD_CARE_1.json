Marta was engaging, kind, and confident and did a great job making our son (and us) feel comfortable. She arrived right on time and provided some last minute flexibility with her schedule when we needed it. Our son is learning Spanish, and she gently practiced with him because she is fluent in both Spanish and English. We will be using her again and weâ€™d definitely recommend her to other parents. ",
