In this time I have seen her manage various K - 8 classrooms with 25+ children, as both an assistant and lead teacher. Dean has also worked closely, one-on-one, with many students as a mentor, and friend. They confide in her and seek her help with issues related to their own personal lives. With all that she does within the school, she is organized, attentive and has created lasting relationships with students of all ages.",
