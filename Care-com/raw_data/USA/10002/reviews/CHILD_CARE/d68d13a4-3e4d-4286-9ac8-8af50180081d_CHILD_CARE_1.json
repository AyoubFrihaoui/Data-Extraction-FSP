From the moment we met her, it was clear that she was not only experienced but genuinely loves working with children. She took the time to get to know our little one, engaging him with games, storytelling, and plenty of activities that kept him entertained.\nShe was incredibly creative, coming up with fun arts and crafts projects that aligned perfectly with our son’s interests. She also implemented a great balance of free play and structured activities, which helped keep him engaged while also teaching him valuable skills.\nCommunication was seamless; she provided us with updates during the day and shared little anecdotes that made us feel connected to our child’s experience. Our son absolutely adored her, and it was heartwarming to see the bond they built in such a short time.\nAdditionally, she was punctual, reliable, and respectful of our home. We felt completely at ease leaving our son in her care knowing he was safe and happy. We will definitely be rebooking her services in the future!\n\nHighly recommend her to anyone looking for a caring and responsible babysitter.",
