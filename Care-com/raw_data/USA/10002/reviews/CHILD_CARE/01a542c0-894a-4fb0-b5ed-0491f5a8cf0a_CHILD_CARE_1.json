            "displayText": "Jaclyn is a super Nanny! We have had the pleasure of her caring for our son C. (9) & daughter N. (4) for the last 4 years. Unfortunately, me & family are moving out of state this summer. Jaclyn picks up & drops off my children from my house in Brooklyn & takes them back to her house where she watches them and her two lovely daughters. I knew when I met Jaclyn I'd hit the jackpot between her credentials & upbeat attitude, I am very lucky to have met her & have my children around her for the last 3 years. Jaclyn is a safe driver of a newer Chevrolet traverse that is spotless & her house is set up perfectly for children with tons of toys, activities, & safety precautions. I never worried about my children going hungry or not having nutritious meals in her care. Jaclyn is an efficient multitasker, she would help my son C. with his homework while simultaneously taking care of the other children & everyone was always happy. Any family will be lucky to have her in their lives!",
