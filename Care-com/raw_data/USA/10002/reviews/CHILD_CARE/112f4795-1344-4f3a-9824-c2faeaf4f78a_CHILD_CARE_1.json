From day one, Nevaeh connected effortlessly with each of the girls, making them feel safe, heard, and entertained.\n\nShe is always punctual, professional, and brings an incredible energy to her time with the kids. Whether it’s organizing fun arts and crafts projects, helping with homework, or reading bedtime stories, she goes above and beyond to make sure each child is engaged and happy. We’ve also appreciated how she manages mealtime and bedtime routines seamlessly—our kids actually look forward to the nights she’s here!\n\nMost importantly, we’ve seen how much the girls adore her and trust her, which gives us such peace of mind when we’re out. We feel so fortunate to have found someone as kind, responsible, and enthusiastic as Nevaeh. If you’re looking for someone who truly cares and treats your children as her own, we wholeheartedly recommend her!",
