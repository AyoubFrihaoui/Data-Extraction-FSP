My kids are older now and I would love to help her find a new family where she can continue to share her remarkable qualities!  She is dependable, honest, caring, and nurturing. She has taken great care of my kids from making sure they eat a good breakfast before school to chauffeuring them to all of their after school activities.  Halima ensures they get their homework done and keeps them entertained when they have down time with arts and crafts projects, card games, and many other activities.  She is always eager to go exploring with the kids and has taken them to farms, pottery places, and other nearby activities.  I can't say enough good things about Halima and I know the whole family will miss her humor and warmth.     ",
