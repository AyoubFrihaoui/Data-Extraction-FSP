They adore her and so do we! I feel incredibly grateful to have found such good care when we need it. Her Montessori and theater school background make her so knowledgeable and fun for the kids. Even the 18 month old screams “Becca!” when she comes through the door. This was my first experience finding care through care.com and my expectations were exceeded in every way. ",
