I have two very active boys and they absolutely love her because she is a lot of fun and I love her because she runs a tight ship. I know their homework and chores will be done and they will get to bed on time. She also ran the barn where my boys go to camp and they loved going on trail rides with her. She is a very responsible and fun babysitter. I never met a kid that did not fall in love with her.",
