            "originalText": "Charlotte has been babysitting for my 5 year old daughter and my 3 year old son for over a year now. She has a wonderful way with kids - specifically making them feel good about themselves and keeping them engaged through positive reinforcement. They are always excited to see her. She gets involved with other parents and other classmates and is always arranging play-dates for my daughter - she brings her to the library and the park regularly. Not afraid to bring them on public transportation or out and about in the city. They are never bored with her and she is such a positive influence on them...patient, kind, creative, and excellent at solving sibling conflicts! I highly recommend her, any family would be lucky to have her.",
