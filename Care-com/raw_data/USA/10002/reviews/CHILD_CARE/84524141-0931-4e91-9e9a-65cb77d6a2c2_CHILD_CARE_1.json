She is always on time, reliable, excellent with children and just absolutely lovely. Kate worked for us once to twice a week all day (7:45-5) for about a year. Our daughter (2.5 years old) loved her and literally would run to the door when kate was coming! Kate took daphne out all day keeping her entertained. She always left our house tidy and organized after having an entire day with a toddler, which isnâ€™t easy! We literally loved loved kate and miss her so much! She is amazing!",
