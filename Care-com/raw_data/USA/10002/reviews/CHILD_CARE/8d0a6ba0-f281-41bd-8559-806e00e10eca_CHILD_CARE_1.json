From playing imaginative games to getting them outdoors, to art and music and projects and silliness my kiddos loved her. She managed a household with three kids including a newborn and an elderly dog. She taught my eldest piano and spent hours crafting and doing art projects with my middle. Her presence with the kids was joyful and they loved having her in their lives. Miranda is creative and energetic and also a fantastic communicator and employee. She spent several years with us in various capacities and we could not have been happier with her care for our kiddos, our pet, and our family!",
