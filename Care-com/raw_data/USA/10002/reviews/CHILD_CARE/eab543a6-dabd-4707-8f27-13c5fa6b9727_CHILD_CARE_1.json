Not only was she a fantastic babysitter, but she also went above and beyond by tutoring my granddaughter to help prepare her for school. The improvement we saw in both her confidence and academic readiness was remarkable. Raven  was incredibly kind, patient, and attentive to every need. She lived with us during this time, and her presence brought so much joy and ease to our home. I feel so fortunate to have had her help, and I would trust her completely with any child. She is truly a gem!",
