She has also been very capable in caring for all four of my children at once (ages 9, 6, 3, and 1). What really sets her apart from other caregivers is how capably she cleans and tidies main areas of our home while tending children. She knows how to engage my kids at their level, making their imaginary worlds come alive. I highly recommend Jaley and am grateful for the part she plays in our family!",
