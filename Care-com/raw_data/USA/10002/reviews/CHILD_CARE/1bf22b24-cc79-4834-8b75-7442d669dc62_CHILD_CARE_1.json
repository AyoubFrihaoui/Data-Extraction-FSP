As a first time mother, I knew absolutely nothing about how to care for a baby. Even worst, I had really bad postpartum. Marisa was patient, empathetic, knowledgeable and nurturing. She gave breastfeeding tips, assisted me with chores, but most importantly she was an amazing care giver to my baby. Our daughter grew to love her immensely. Marisa helped her excel at all milestones. She taught her letters, numbers, shapes, colors very early on. She combed her hair, groomed her nails and always kept her well dressed. Our daughter was the little diva of the town. Marisa is very organized and keeps a clean work space. She read books daily and kept B engaged all day. We were lucky to have her be a part of the family and highly recommend her services.",
