I gave her my address but told her that I would like to do a video call just so I can meet her before she came. I called and texted she wouldn't answer. She responded the next day saying that she worked late and that she would be here at the time that we agreed on. The day before she was coming, I called her and texted her to do a video call and I received no answer. That was the last time I heard from Caterina And I am disgusted at what she did. Do not hire her nobody wants someone that is unreliable",
