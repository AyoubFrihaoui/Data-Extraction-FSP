She doesn’t just do the job; she brings warmth, dedication, and a genuine heart for service. Honestly, she’s become part of the family, even surprising us with some amazing homemade vegan meals. I could go on and on about how incredible she is, but let’s just say—I wish we could have her with us every day!",
