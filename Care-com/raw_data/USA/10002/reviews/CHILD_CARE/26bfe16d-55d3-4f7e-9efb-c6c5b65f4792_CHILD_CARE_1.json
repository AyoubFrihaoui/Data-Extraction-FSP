She was always a good example of kindness and respect for others with her mild-mannered ways.\nKatherine helped with homework, meals/snacks, shuttled them to parks, aquarium, ice cream parlor etc.,  and was someone we could always rely on to pick our kids from school.  Safety was always first on the road or in our home.  \nKatherine M. was flexible with her schedule and helped out on short notices multiple times.\nConducts herself professionally, extremely honest, caring, responsible, friendly and we \nrecommend her 100%.",
