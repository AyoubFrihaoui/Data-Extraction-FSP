She is dedicated, kind, patient, responsible and most importantly, loves our kids. As a new mom, I had so many anxieties around finding quality childcare and Camila exceeded all my expectations. Camila is great at managing a balanced daily schedule for a baby and toddler that includes naps, meal prep and feedings, play time and story time. She always ensured that the kids laundry was washed and put away, cleaned play areas, took them to weekly story time at the local library, potty trained my toddler, prepared healthy meals, and even taught my toddler some Spanish and baby sign language. I am so grateful that our paths crossed and she was able to take care of my babies when I had to return to work.  ",
