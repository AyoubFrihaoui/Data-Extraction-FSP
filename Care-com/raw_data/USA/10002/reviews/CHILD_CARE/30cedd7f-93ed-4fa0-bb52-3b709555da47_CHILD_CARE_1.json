            "originalText": "I can’t say enough wonderful things about Sharon! She cared for my toddler for three months a few times a week while we were in New York for business, and honestly, they’ve set the bar incredibly high. From the moment we met, I could tell how naturally she connects with children. My little boy warmed up to her instantly, and that peace of mind as a parent is priceless.\nWhat amazed me most was the creative ways Sharon kept my baby engaged and happy. Every day felt like a little adventure. She turned our living room into a magical space—whether it was crafting colorful masterpieces with finger paint and glitter (yes, glitter, and they cleaned it all up!) or building entire cities out of blocks and toy cars. One day, she set up a pretend bakery where my toddler “baked” cookies out of playdough, complete with sprinkles that she brought herself to play with. Another day, they led a safari adventure, using stuffed animals and making binoculars out of paper towel rolls.\nMy little boy really enjoyed story time. Sharon didn’t just read books, she acted them out, complete with funny voices and gestures that made my toddler giggle endlessly.\nBut beyond all the fun, it was clear how much Sharon truly cared. She paid attention to every little detail, making sure naps were on schedule, meals were eaten (even those picky moments!), and that my toddler always felt safe and loved. She kept me updated with sweet photos and little stories about their day, which always brought a smile to my face, even on busy workdays.\nHaving Sharon with us was like having an extended member of our family. She wasn’t just a babysitter—she was a person in my child’s growth and happiness. If you’re lucky enough to have her care for your child, you’ll see exactly what I mean. We’ll always be grateful for the joy and creativity she brought into our lives!",
