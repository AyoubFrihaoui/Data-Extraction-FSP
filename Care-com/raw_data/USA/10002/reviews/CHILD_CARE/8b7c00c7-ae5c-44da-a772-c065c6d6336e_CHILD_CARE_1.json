            "originalText": "We are absolutely thrilled with the incredible care and support that Jonathan has provided to our 4-month-old this summer. From the very beginning, it was evident that he had a genuine passion for working with children. He not only proactively intuits and takes care of our little one's basic needs, but goes above and beyond to ensure she feels loved and engaged throughout the day. It's so sweet to see how much she adores him, as he showers her with attention and playtime, creating a nurturing and joyful environment.\n\nOne aspect of Jonathan's professionalism that stands out is his reliability and responsiveness. We can always rely on him to respond to our texts and show up when we need him, and that level of communication brings us peace of mind every day. Furthermore, we appreciate his initiative and willingness to help around the house without even being asked. It's truly a blessing to have someone who not only takes excellent care of our baby but also contributes to keeping our home clean and organized.\n\nWe are also incredibly grateful for Jonathan's commitment and flexibility. There have been numerous occasions when he stayed late to assist with our 4-year-old while I prepared dinner. His ability to multitask and handle both children with ease is impressive and greatly appreciated. Our older child has also formed a bond with Jonathan, which speaks volumes about his caring nature and ability to connect with kids of all ages.\n\nIn summary, Jonathan has been a godsend to our family. We feel fortunate to have found someone so caring, responsible, and proactive in ensuring the well-being of our children. He has truly become an essential part of our family, and we wholeheartedly recommend him to any family seeking an exceptional nanny. Thank you, Jonathan, for your outstanding dedication and love for our little ones. \n\nFeel free to ask Jonathan for my contact details, I would be happy to discuss further :) ",
