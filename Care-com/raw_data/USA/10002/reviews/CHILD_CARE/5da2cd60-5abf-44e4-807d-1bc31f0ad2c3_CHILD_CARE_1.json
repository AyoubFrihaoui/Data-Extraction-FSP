By then, Dylan had grown to be a part of our family and we absolutely loved him. Since then, he has helped us with so many things. He is our \"go to\" when we go out of town and need a house / dog sitter. Every time we return home the house seems to be in better condition than we left it! Anytime we are in need of childcare, Dylan is our go to. There have been times when we have had to go out of town and Dylan watched our youngest for 3 days overnight. We have nothing but great things to say about Dylan. Feel free to contact me with any questions. ",
