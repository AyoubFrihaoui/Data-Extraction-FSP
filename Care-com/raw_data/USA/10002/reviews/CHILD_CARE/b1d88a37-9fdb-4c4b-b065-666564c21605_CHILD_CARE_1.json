She practices open communication with the kids and parents. I can’t say enough good things. We trust her and we love her, and it’s very hard to say goodbye to having her in our day-to-day lives.

She is a true problem solver and would bring possible solutions to the table as we navigated a separation and dealt with neurodiversity/special needs with one of our children. Her communication skills are excellent, and I would highly recommend her to any family looking for someone to take an active role in their family.",
