For the past two years, Claudia took care of my two girls (now 3 & 5) giving them tons of love, playing with them, and quickly became part of our family. Claudia has also cleaned our house making it look organized and sparkling clean and from time to time has cooked for us delicious Colombian food!. Sadly we had to move out of State but I recommend her to any family looking for someone trustworthy, respecful, and loving. ",
