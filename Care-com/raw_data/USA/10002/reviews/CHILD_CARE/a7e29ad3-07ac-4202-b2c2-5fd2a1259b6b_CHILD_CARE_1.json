There is not a single person I trust more than Amanda to be alone with my son. She is attentive, protective, fun, engaging, and very nurturing. Every time my son had a fever it was Amanda that actually noticed it first and alerted us. She notices every detail about him. I appreciate that she is aware of each upcoming milestone and comes up with creative ways to support my son's development. He is flourishing under Amanda's care. Any family will be lucky to have her.",
