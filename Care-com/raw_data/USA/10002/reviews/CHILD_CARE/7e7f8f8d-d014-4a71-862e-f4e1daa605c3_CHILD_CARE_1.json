She communicates very well always providing updates throughout the day, and reinforcing routine schedules and behaviors we were teaching to our child, which we really appreciated. She went above and beyond to provide an enriched and nourished time with our child - from teaching new songs, dances, reading books, and even bringing supplies to make art with our child. They build a very special bond, our child genuinely looked forward to seeing Simone. We highly recommend Simone! She started with us full time, but since October our child started schools and Simone needed more hours, which we could no longer provide, unfortunately. Hire Simone, she is absolutely the best!!",
