She cared for our two children (6 months and 4 years old) consistently for six months, and we couldn't have asked for a better babysitter.\n\nShe was reliable, patient, and truly engaged with both kids at their different developmental stages.\nOur infant was always well-cared for, and she handled feedings, naps, and diaper changes with ease. She also planned fun, age-appropriate activities for our 4-year-old, keeping them entertained and learning at the same time. It was clear she genuinely cared about their well-being and happiness.\n\nShe was always on time, communicated well, and made us feel at ease when leaving our children in her care. If you're looking for a trustworthy, responsible, and loving babysitter, I highly recommend",
