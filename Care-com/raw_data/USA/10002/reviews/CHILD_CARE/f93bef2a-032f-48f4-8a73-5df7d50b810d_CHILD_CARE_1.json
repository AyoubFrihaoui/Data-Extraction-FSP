Melenie is not only a dedicated NYC nurse, but she is also incredibly attentive and puts my child's safety and well-being first. She goes above and beyond to ensure that Logan is engaged and entertained, taking him to movies, parks, museums, and organizing various fun activities for him. One of the things I appreciate most about Melenie is her professionalism and punctuality. She is always on time and conducts herself in a professional manner. Logan always has a great time with her and looks forward to her visits. Additionally, Melenie is a great cook and prepares healthy meals for Logan. She also helps him with his homework, which has been a huge help for me as a busy parent.",
