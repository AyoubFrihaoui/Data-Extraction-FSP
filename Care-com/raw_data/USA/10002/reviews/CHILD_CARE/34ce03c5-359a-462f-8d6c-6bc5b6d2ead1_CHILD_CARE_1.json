We urgently needed help, and like many, I found letting someone in to our world and building trust a huge hurdle. Thankfully we found the most wonderful caretaker who has been with us now 4 weeks. \n\nShe has gently and competently landed in our world and shown me so much grace, care and understanding. Most importantly she shows genuine love and care for our son who adores her. She is beyond reliable, I don’t think she’s ever shown up a minute late and comes to us with her full energy creating magic in our small space. \n\nWe are relocating shortly and her schedule will free up and I’d happily help her transition to a new family while we are here. We are both at home while she’s with our baby, but I know she’s done her fair share of taking kids out and about, and being solo with a range of ages.\n\nThank you for helping us immeasurably and being such a positive person in our world. We will miss you. ",
