            "displayText": "As a nanny to our one-year-old son for the past 10 months, Melissa M. has proven herself to be a remarkably responsible and energetic caretaker. Melissa started working for our family full-time in August, 2013, when our son was only 10-weeks old.  \r\nNot only does Melissa have years of experience as a nanny and specialized training as a baby nurse, but she truly puts it into practice. As a first time mom I had many questions and Melissa was a valuable source of information and reassurance. She often calmed my fears and provided helpful advice as to how to care for our newborn son. Each day she played with our son, read and sang to him, and took him outside our home on long walks to the park and nearby attractions. Melissa fed him balanced, healthy meals and even helped me when I had questions concerning breastfeeding. She was consistently caring and loving towards our son.\r\nMelissa also maintained a detailed log of our son's daily activities so I could stay informed of his eating and sleeping habits. I enjoyed reading about their day together and Melissa always made sure I felt included in any new milestones our son achieved while I was away from the home. She is very attentive to details and followed my instructions closely as to how I wished to structure our son's day. Melissa also assisted me in getting our son on a sleep schedule. \r\nOur son has some minor physical delays and receives therapy three days a week. Melissa accompanied me to the appointments so she could learn the PT exercises and work with our son on her own during the week. Day after day Melissa enveloped him in encouragement and her patience and positive attitude have helped my son continue to progress. She managed to make the therapy sessions fun and even our PT therapist has commented to me privately on how great Melissa interacts with our son and motivates him to reach new milestones. \r\nWe deeply regret that we are losing Melissa as our nanny, but due to our decision to relocate out of New York state it will no longer be possible for her to commute to our new residence. I am confident that she will always be a part of our lives and we look forward to keeping in touch with Melissa. She will always be welcome in our home.\r\nI recommend Melissa with full confidence. She is an outstanding nanny and person. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you would like to talk more about our experiences with her.",
