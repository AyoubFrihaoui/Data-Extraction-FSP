Over this time, she became much more than a nanny-she truly became a cherished part of our family.

She ensured he was constantly learning, growing, and entertained, all while giving him an abundance of love and care. She consistently arrived early and was always flexible - whether we needed her after work hours, on weekends, or even overnight for our short getaways, she was always there to support us.
