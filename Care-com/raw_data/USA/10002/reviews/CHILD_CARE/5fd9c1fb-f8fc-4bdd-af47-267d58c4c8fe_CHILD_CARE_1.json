As she nannied for our first son there was much we didnâ€™t know as first time parents that she was instrumental in us learning about like trimming their nails and cleaning snot from their noses when they have a cold. \nOn top of all of the amazing childcare duties she attended to she also helped keep our house clean, ran errands for us and even cooked dinner one night a week. \nAloura also brought her son with her and it was a great experience for our son to be around another baby. Aloura balanced to 2 kids needs flawlessly and used the opportunity to teach them important concepts like sharing. \nOur relationship as a family with Aloura grew so strong that even a year, and a cross country move, away from our time together we still keep in touch. \nWe would provide the highest of recommendations to anyone considering Aloura as their childcare provider!",
