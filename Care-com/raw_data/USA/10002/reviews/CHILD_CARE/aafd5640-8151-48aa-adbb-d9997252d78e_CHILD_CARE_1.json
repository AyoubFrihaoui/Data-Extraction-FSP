            "originalText": "We had the absolute pleasure of having Felicita as our nanny, and we cannot speak highly enough of her exceptional care and dedication. From the very first day, Felicita displayed an incredible level of professionalism, warmth, and genuine love for my son.\n\nFelicita seamlessly blended into my family, always going above and beyond to ensure my son’s safety, happiness, and development. She embraced every aspect of her role with enthusiasm, whether it was engaging in creative play, assisting with homework, or organizing fun and educational activities. My son adored her, and we could see his excitement each day she arrived.\n\nOne of Felicita’s standout qualities is her reliability and punctuality. She was always on time, and I never had to worry about her commitment. Her communication with me was excellent; she kept me informed of my son’s daily activities and any milestones or concerns, which created a strong sense of trust and peace of mind.\n\nMoreover, Felicita’s nurturing and patient demeanor helped my son develop important social and emotional skills. She approached every situation with calm and positivity, teaching my son valuable lessons in kindness and respect.\n\nI also appreciated how attentive Felicita was to our household routines and needs. She helped maintain a tidy home environment and even pitched in with meal prep, making my life so much easier.\n\nOverall, Felicita has been an indispensable part of my family, and I am deeply grateful for the love and care she has provided. I highly recommend Felicita to any family looking for a dedicated, reliable, and loving nanny. She truly is a gem, and we will miss her dearly. ",
