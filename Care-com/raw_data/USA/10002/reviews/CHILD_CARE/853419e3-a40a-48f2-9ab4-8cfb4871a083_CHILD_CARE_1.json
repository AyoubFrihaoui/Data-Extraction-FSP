We asked her to commit to working with us on a recurring night once a week, and our arrangement works well. We know we can count on her, and if she ever needs to change the schedule, she lets us know far in advance. She's a great communicator, and follows our instructions well. She handles each of the 4 kids wonderfully (ages 3.5â€“infant), and they enjoy spending time with her. Our pets also love her! We're very happy to have her babysit every week.",
