Unfortunately, he started daycare full time so we had to part ways. He absolutely loves her. She is dependable, always punctual and very patient and loving with our son. She sends us videos and pictures throughout the day and updates us on his schedule. We feel completely comfortable with Aminta and would highly recommend her to other parents.",
