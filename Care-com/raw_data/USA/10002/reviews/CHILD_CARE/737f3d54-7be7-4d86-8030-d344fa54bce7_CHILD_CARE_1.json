            "displayText": "Klara has worked with us for 5+ years.  She came to us when our oldest was 18 months old and our second was nearly born.  Since then, she has seen 2 more children added to our family.  Yes, that is a total of 4 ranging from 6 - newborn.  I have been able to see Klara seamlessly handle all the children (one on one and all at once) with grace, love, patience, and a nurturing that I don't see often in babysitters/nannies.  \r\n\r\nShe has seen all the challenges and struggles that we faced from tantrums, to biting, to sibling rivalry and jealousy.  She has not just told the boys what to do but rather has taught them how they should behave and ways to achieve their goals.  She is truly a loved member of our family.  I trust her 100% with our children.  I know that she can handle the boys and keep her sanity.  \r\n\r\nWe still use Klara off and on however, given that I stay home and the older boys are in school, we don't need somebody full time.  If we did have that need, I would happily hire her full time.  I have no hesitation in recommending her to your family.",
