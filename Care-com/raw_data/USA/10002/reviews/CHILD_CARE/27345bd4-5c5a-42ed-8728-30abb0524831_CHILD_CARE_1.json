            "originalText": "Daniiela was a regular caregiver for my two boys ages 3 and 8. I cannot say enough about how helpful she was and how much energy and positivity she brought to the role everyday. Daniela helped pickup the boys from school and took them everywhere on adventures - Central Park, playgrounds, the museum and more. She organized play dates regularly and made them delicious meals (in fact, i asked her to make the same for my husband & me too!) she was able to connect with the boys and meet them where they are in terms of what they required to feel safe and engaged. She’s warm and loving and playful. I’m confident she will excel in any role for which she’s hired. ",

We reached out to her with short notice but she was available and was flexible with her hours. She kept our boys very occupied and engaged the whole time, made sure they were fed and was just so pleasant to be around.   She has a deep knowledge of marvel superheroes which my 4 year old deeply appreciated.  As soon as she left he wanted to know when she would come back. Will def. Rehire!",
