My son no longer needs childcare, but Leslie still cares for my daughter.  And when she is with her, she gives her full attention.  Leslie reads to her, plays with her and talks with her.  I honestly cannot imagine a better caregiver.  I feel so lucky to have her caring for my children and helping my family.  Please do let me know if have any questions or concerns.  Thank you so much.
