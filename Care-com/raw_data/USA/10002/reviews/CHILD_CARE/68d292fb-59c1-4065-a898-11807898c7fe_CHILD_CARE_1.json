She looked after my two kids (12 and 6) throughout 2023, and we absolutely love her.\n\nJahna is incredibly creative and fun. One time, she came over with a bunch of craft supplies and suggested making our own storybooks. My kids, who usually can’t stay off their screens, were totally hooked. They spent the whole afternoon drawing, writing, and decorating their books. It was such a hit that they still talk about it and proudly show off their creations.\n\nJahna is also responsible which makes us feel very comfortable leaving the kids with her. She’s always on time and keeps us updated on what they’re doing.\n\nJahna has a knack for making people feel happy and engaged. She’s got a positive vibe and is genuinely caring, which makes her an amazing babysitter.\n\nIf you’re looking for someone great to watch your kids, you can’t go wrong with Jahna. She’s fantastic!",
