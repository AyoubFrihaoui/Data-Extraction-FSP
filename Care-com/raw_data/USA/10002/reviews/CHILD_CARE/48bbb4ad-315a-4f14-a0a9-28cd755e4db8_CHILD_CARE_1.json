She was there for my kids from the time my youngest son was an infant and his brother was just under 18 months old. She worked for me for 5 years and was always there for my kids - morning, noon and night. No task, no need, no snack nor meal was ever missed by Tashi especially when it came to keeping my kids, happy, active, well rested, playful and educated at a young age. I highly recommend Tashi as a nanny, caregiver, a babysitter or any other job that requires love and devotion to a family. ",
