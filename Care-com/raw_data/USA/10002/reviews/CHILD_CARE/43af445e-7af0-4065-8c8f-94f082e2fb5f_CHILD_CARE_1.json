            "originalText": "Monae worked for my family from January 2020 through June 2020. She was hired as a part-time babysitter. Her responsibilities included picking up my 4 year old from school, bringing him to his various activities, preparing dinner for him, and getting him ready for bed. Around March 2020, after the COVID-19 outbreak, she began working full time hours. In this capacity, she was watching my son, helping him with his remote learning, providing supplemental tutoring, preparing his meals, and getting him ready for bed in the evenings.\nThroughout her time with us, she was always prompt and attentive to the needs of my son. She enforced the rules I had, and was very proactive in finding different educational activities for him to do. She was flexible when I needed her to work extra hours and made sure to clean up after my son. Monae is very experienced with children and excels at tutoring - she was able to keep my son on task and was very diligent and organized about planning lessons for him when school was no longer in session. We parted ways at the end of June when my son started attending camp full time and we no longer needed a babysitter.\nMonae is a very hard-working, organized, and capable individual who is serious about her work and is diligent and focused on whatever she is working on.",

Their conditions cause them to be, at times, irrational, defiant, explosive, inflexible, unfocused, and impulsive. Managing and supporting them in daily tasks and activities requires the right attitude and a strong desire to understand what factors drive their maladaptive behaviors. It is an extraordinarily demanding position, both physically and \nmentally. \nMonae has shown integrity and determination by committing to work with us long-term. She took courses on understanding the psychological roots of my children's difficulties and independently researched related topics. She arrives on time or early and reliably follows through on her scheduling commitments to us, always mindfully planning. She is organized and takes detailed notes on my instructions, which is particularly important to me regarding the administration of medications. She also spends personal time looking for programs and therapeutic activities to help my children. \n\nWe are sad to lose her due to an international move!",
