            "originalText": "Karina was our nanny for a little over two years for my two kids in LA (she was with us when my son was a newborn and my daughter was 2.5 years old, they are now two and almost 5 years old) she was a fantastic nanny. My kids enjoyed a range of activities with her, lots of walks, outside time, chalk, arts and crafts, and they loved spending time with her. Karina is easy to work with.  In addition to being great with the children, Karina is an excellent communicator via phone, text, and shared documents.  Coordinating the schedule is easy, and she is very reasonable, trustworthy, and flexible. We highly recommend her!",
