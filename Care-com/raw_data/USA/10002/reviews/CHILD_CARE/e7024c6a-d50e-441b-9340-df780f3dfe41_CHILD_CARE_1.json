She is not only experienced but also has an invaluable intuition that I found so reassuring as a first time mom seeking help with my 4 month old. Amanda accurately interpreted my baby’s cues - something I didn’t feel anyone else (family included) totally understood. I observed her many times correctly identify that he was hungry, tired, teething, etc. and act immediately to comfort him. Her skill gives me peace of mind leaving my little one in her care. On the experience side, she often guides our family with helpful purchase suggestions appropriate for baby’s development, for example frozen chew toys that helped his teething. She is truly sweet, patient, and exudes a lovely calm presence. ",

            "originalText": "Let me first start off by saying Amanda is amazing! I initially was searching for someone to watch our son as we were planning a family birthday dinner, however, the first time we were trying to plan the outing fell through, so we didn't end up getting to work with Amanda that time, but she was so understanding and leading up to that event she went above and beyond for us to chat on the phone and to help comfort me as this would be the first time we were leaving our son with someone other than family. At that time we weren't able to set-up a time for her to get acquainted with our son, but the next time we reached out to her, she was able to arrange coming on the earlier side so that my son had time to meet her and play with her before we left. Amanda is super responsive and communicative, and she is flexible, definitely going off of the vibe of the parents/family and their wants/needs. The things that drew me to Amanda's profile to start were her abundance of 5 star reviews, and also her evident love for Disney as seen in her pictures, which is a love our family shares as well. Our son is super comfortable with her and she makes him feel at ease, to the point where he feels safe enough to say goodbye to us when we leave with no tears. I can't say enough good things about Amanda and the care she provides. We still work with Amanda to this day!",

We were visiting my sister in Brooklyn with my 2 and 4 year old and staying at a hotel (1 bedroom, 2 beds, small Brooklyn style hotel!) but we really wanted to go out for dinner one night without the kids to catch up more. Amanda expertly handled the kids’ bedtimes in a new weird place and rolled with the punches!  She also obviously has a ton of experience with toddlers because she asked all of the right questions before we left to make sure the transition went smoothly when we left and for bedtime.  I always get nervous leaving my young kids w a new sitter in a big city like Brooklyn, but I will hire Amanda again in a heart beat and I will be reaching out again next time we visit my sister.  Highly recommend!!",
