Jennifer has always struck the right balance between bringing her own experience and guidance to our children's care. We can't recommend her highly enough. She has been providing excellent, dependable care for our children & my elderly mother. She has become a part of our family. Jennifer does \"projects\" with our children each day, including crafts, cooking, and art. She prepares healthy snacks and is an organizing force in our hectic household. We would recommend Judy without reservation.",

I used Care.com to find a babysitter for our lovely 11-month-old crawling machine. We shortlisted Jennifer based on her profile, but she easily won the interview process and her background check was spotless. We were asking somebody to watch our only child in the hotel room, so I took this very seriously. I feel so lucky Jennifer was available. She sang to our boy, brought him gifts, gave us tips to get around the city, spoke French to him, and I'm fairly certain our boy fell in love with her. He normally has a little separation anxiety when we leave him at daycare or with a sitter. With Jennifer, he smiled, clapped and couldn't wait for us to leave, so she could speak French and sing to him. We were so impressed with Jennifer that we hope she can watch him again one day. I recommend Jennifer to any families looking for a sitter in New York while traveling. Her focus was all about the child, and that's all parents can ask for.",
