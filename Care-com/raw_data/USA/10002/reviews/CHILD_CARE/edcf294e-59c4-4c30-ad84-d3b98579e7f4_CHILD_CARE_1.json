            "originalText": "Bel is, in one word, INCREDIBLE! She has helped us care for our two children, ages 2 and 6, since March 2022, including most of the summer of 2022.\n\nBel is organized, punctual, respectful, kind, and highly engaged. She also communicates well about her schedule and any expectations around future scheduling. She has early childhood experience and training, and it shows in how she works with, plays with, and guides the girls. She has endless patience, and is creative and enthusiastic. It's clear to me that Bel loves what she does, and the girls love spending time with her.\n\nIn addition to nannying, Bel has also tutored the 6-year-old in math and reading. She has also helped the 2-year-old to learn the alphabet and many songs.\n\nBel feels like a member of our family and we have been the beneficiaries of the invaluable work ethic and spirit that she has. I highly recommend Bel to any family who is seeking a professional, nurturing, and highly engaged nanny.",
