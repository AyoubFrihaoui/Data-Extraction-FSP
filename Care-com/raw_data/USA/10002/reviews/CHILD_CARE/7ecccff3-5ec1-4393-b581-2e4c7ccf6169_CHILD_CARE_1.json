Among the several nannies we had in the past, Shirley was one who showed the most professionalism and love and care for our 3 year-old girl. She always showed up to work on time and was highly dependable. She was professional in her demeanor and really loved and cared for our daughter and played with her while genuinely having a good time. Our daughter had so much fun with Shirley and Shirley also set up several play dates which helped our daughter develop social skills. Further, she read tons of books and worked with our daughter to develop necessary skills. Shirley was always great at communicating with us and promptly followed the schedule we provided. There was never a time when we thought our daughter's well-being was in question when she was with Shirley. She is a great person who really cares for the child.",

            "displayText": "Shirley has been babysitting my 21-month old son since we moved to NYC in November. My son loves spending time with her. Shirley is a very warm and nurturing caregiver. My son warmed up to her immediately. She gets down on the floor to play with him and knows exactly how to engage him in creative, stimulating activities. Shirley is also very reliable and easy to work with. She straightens up after my son, feeds him, and puts him to bed with no issues. She always sends us pictures so we know how he's doing. Shirley has also watched my sister's 2.5 year old, and she also speaks highly of her experience.  I would highly recommend Shirley as a care giver.",
