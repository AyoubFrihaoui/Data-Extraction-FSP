She is responsible, smart, psychologically minded, warm, creative, fun and firm when she needs to be. She is a perfect match for our family.  In addition to working for our family, she has lots of other child care experience and many friends/people in our community have hired her after seeing how wonderful she is with my children.  \n\nMy girls are now 8 and 11 and our childcare needs have changed- which is the only reason we don't employ her weekly any longer.  We still see Kira often as she is like a part of our family now and she still babysits for date nights too.  You would be lucky to have Kira in your life! ",
