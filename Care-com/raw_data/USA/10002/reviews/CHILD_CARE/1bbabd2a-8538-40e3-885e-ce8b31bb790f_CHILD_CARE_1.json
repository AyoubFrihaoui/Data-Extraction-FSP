Mary's warm, joyful, and loving nature made her stand out, and continued after we hired her. When our daughter was a baby, Mary would talk with her and interact with her all day, and get down on the floor with her and play. She made her fresh pureed baby foods. As our daughter has grown older Mary makes delicious, healthy meals (for our daughter and for all of us--she is an accomplished cook), spends much of the day outdoors with our daughter, takes her to classes/play dates, etc., does our laundry, and helps us keep our home / lives running smoothly.",
