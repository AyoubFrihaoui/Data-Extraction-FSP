She primarily was with our 3 year old daughter but also occasionally watched our 8 year old son as well. When we weren’t home, knowing that it was Yashmini who our children were with put our minds at ease. She pays attention to the details and goes the extra mile in her care. It isn’t easy trusting your children with just anyone but Yashmini is definitely one with whom you can do just that. We will miss her very much. You will not regret hiring her. She will be a blessing to any family that needs her just as she was to us. ",
