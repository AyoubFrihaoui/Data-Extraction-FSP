They naturally gravitate towards her and they know that when she comes to care for them, it is going to be a day full of fun and activities for them. \n\nI love how Camille cares for my kids for the following reasons:\n* My kids love her\n* She preps healthy snacks for my kids.\n* Takes them to the public library for story-telling \n* Takes them to every single park around my neighborhood\n* When my kids are sick, she follows all my medication instructions perfectly!\n* She is fun and very energetic\n* She genuinely loves kids\n* When my kids misbehave, she talks to them- no screaming, yelling, losing\ntemper etc...\n* She has a great personality and always welcomes any feedback from my\npartner or me.\n* Keeps me up to date of whatever activities she has decided to do with the kids.\n* She bathes my kids to prep them to sleep if I'm running late\n* I trust Camille 100 percent with my kids. My kids are a handful, especially my\nboy and she manages very well with both of them. \n\nThese are some of the reasons why I like having Camille as my sitter whenever I\nneed the help.\n\nLastly, Camille continues to care for my children 8 & 10 years old on some occasions when NYC Schools are closed. My kids simply adore her.",

She is very articulate and seemed very honest, trustworthy and appeared to be very dedicated and committed to children.  She is motivated and has taken several child education courses and classes. We strongly considered hiring her and I do think she would be a good nanny for us.  We hope she finds a loving family to work with.  She would be a great addition.",
