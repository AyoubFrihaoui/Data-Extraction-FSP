            "displayText": "Jennifer is a great nanny. She was with us full time while our twin girls were 5 months until they were 7 months. We knew immediately that she really enjoys being around children.  \r\nOne of our kids is a little shy and Jennifer was very patient, letting her warm up first and then engaging with her. She clearly communicated each day's activities and let us know if anything our of the ordinary happened (one baby didn't nap for very long). She respected the rules and guidelines we set and asked questions to clarify anything we didn't go over. Jennifer often read books to the kids and took them to the park. We always knew our kids were in safe and capable hands. Jennifer would still be in our employment, however, I have decided to stay home with the kids.",

When my fiancee and I first interviewed Jennifer, she came across as knowledgeable and very experienced, particularly with children who were not related to her (makes a big difference!) and in long-term child care. When we hired her in Sept. 2012, our children immediately took a liking to her as well. She has proven to be resourceful and very flexible as our schedules can vary. She takes the kids to the park and other activities when its feasible and helps with homework and other initiatives. Altogether, she is the ideal candidate for a caregiver. We're certainly glad to have her on board!",
