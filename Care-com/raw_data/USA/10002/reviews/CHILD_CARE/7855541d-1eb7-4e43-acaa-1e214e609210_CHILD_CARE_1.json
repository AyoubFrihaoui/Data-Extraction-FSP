What we loved about her: She was very creative in making meals that my picky toddler would like to actually eat and not smear all over the table and feed to the dog. She also was a nap time connoisseur and somehow managed to get my tot down for a nap every day. She came up with great games to help with my sons motor skills and fun art projects. Lastly, the baby's laundry would be cleaned and folded daily which mama could not have been more grateful for! She also would send daily photos and videos of my son which I loved. The bond that my tot made with her was truly special.",
