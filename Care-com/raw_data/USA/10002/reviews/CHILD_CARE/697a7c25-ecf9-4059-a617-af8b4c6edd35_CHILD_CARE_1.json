She provided wonderful references, she stated realistic arrival times, always texted when she was about to head over, always took a pic of our dog being walked (as we requested), let us know that things were taken care of, and also let us know that she was leaving. I will be hiring her again and I'm very grateful that we were connected with someone so diligent and responsible. Marya also goes above and beyond, doing more than asked, and I truly appreciate her honesty and her care. ",
