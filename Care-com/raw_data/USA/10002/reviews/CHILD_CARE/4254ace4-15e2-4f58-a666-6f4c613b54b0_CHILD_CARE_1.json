We only stopped using her because of scheduling and daycare opportunities. We still use her for date night. \r\n\r\nOur son is very high energy and has a ton of food allergies. Heather was brave enough to take on following our very specific instructions of how he needed to be fed. She also did a great job of taking him to the playground and library so they were not in the apartment all day. She taught him manners, read to him and worked on colors, letters and numbers. She always communicated with us when they were together and if she had any issues with her commute. She took great care of both our kids! We highly recommend her!",
