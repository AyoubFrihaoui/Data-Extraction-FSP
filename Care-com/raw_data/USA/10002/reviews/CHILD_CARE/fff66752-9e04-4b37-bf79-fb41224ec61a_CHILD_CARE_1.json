She's warm and enthusiastic, and our son took to her immediately. She continued to babysit for us off and on until our son was a little over one, and we moved out of the city. She's extremely reliable and punctual. She was also great about sending updates as to how he was doing, and what they'd done. I couldn't recommend her more highly!",
