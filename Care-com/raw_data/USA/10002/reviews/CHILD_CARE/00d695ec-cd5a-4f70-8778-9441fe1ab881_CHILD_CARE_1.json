            "originalText": "Mardel was an absolute blessing during my transition to Brooklyn after I moved from the suburbs with my twin 1-year old girls. Her warmth and patience created such a happy environment for my girls, and her calm demeanor was exactly what my busy household needed. Among the many things that impressed me about Mardel was her ability to encourage gentle interactions between my twins and help them learn early social skills — no small feat with babies this age!\n\nMardel's caring nature and strong work ethic were evident in her daily interactions with my children. She would often sing songs with the girls, filling our home with joy and smiles. Her attention to detail extended beyond childcare to keeping my house wonderfully tidy and organized. She was meticulous with chores like laundry and dishes, and even offered great suggestions for improving efficiency in the kitchen. We felt very lucky when she would share delicious baked treats that she made at home. \n\nShe was incredibly reliable, arriving punctually every single day, and her talent at preparing healthy, delicious meals made mealtimes something the girls looked forward to. As a single mom, I had complete peace of mind knowing my daughters were in such capable, trustworthy hands. And as an unexpected bonus, she had an amazing talent for styling the girls' hair with braids and perky ponytails, making them look gorgeous every day! (With me they will barely sit still long enough for me to put on a single hair tie…)\n\nMardel was a true partner in caring for my daughters during an important transition period, and I'm deeply grateful for the positive impact she had on our lives.\n",

She is amazing with children and has helped shape them into kind, funny, and clever toddlers. She is great with infants and as our girls got older, she adapts her style to meet them at different developmental stages. She is patient during toddler tantrums and we work as a team to find solutions when we face any parenting challenges. She taught us a lot when we were first time parents! We don't know what we would do without Mardel. The only reason she is seeking another job is because our girls are attending school and we don't need full time childcare. Mardel is a gem. It's difficult to find someone as trustworthy, kindhearted, and lovely as her. She is our family. I am happy to recommend her to anyone who's seeking a nanny.
