She has been able to balance taking them on adventures (to the parks/beaches/etc) along with making sure they have time at home to rest and play. She is very patient with them and they have been able to grow and learn a lot from her.\r\nOutside of taking care of our children, Abi has also stepped into the role of household manager. She helps with our meal planning, grocery shopping and meal prep. She is a great cook and makes healthy plant based meals with a wide variety of foods. She helps with organization of the house and also with keeping the house clean and tidy. She also helps with running errands if they come up during days that she is work. We would highly recommend Abi to any family!",
