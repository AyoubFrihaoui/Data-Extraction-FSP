            "originalText": "\nSeema came into my world at a time when things were really tough. We had just had our second baby, I had a really short maternity leave, and we were really struggling as a family. Seema started out on weekends, and instantly made life so much better. Her role grew because we liked her so much and she started coming in weekdays. For the past two years, she’s been coming in very early on weekdays and occasional weekends. What a difference it has made—the only way my husband and I have managed with demanding jobs and personal commitments is the teamwork from Seema. \n\nSeema has really been there for my family when we have needed it. She has slept over when I’ve been sick, taken care of the kids when they’ve been sick, and countless times worked full weekends when we needed it. \n\nSeema loves kids, and they love her. I am not exaggerating when I say think she has more pictures of my kids than I do. They have such a special bond, and knowing my kids are with someone who truly enjoys spending time with them is beyond valuable.  \n\nDue to a change in circumstances for our family, we had to make the difficult decision to let Seema go. I have agonized over how much we’ll miss her because I can’t overstate what a blessing Seema has been to our family.  To show my gratitude for the love and care she’s shown our whole family, I hope to find her a great family who she can support just like she did ours. ",

She was calm and loving with our three kids, ages 6, 4 and 18 months, which take a lot o patience to handle.  She kept the place sparkling and did the laundry for kiddos numerous times a week.  She was willing to jump in to help at all times, even willing to take the trash down which I have found other sitters won't do.  I could not have been happier and if we hadn't been trying to find another au pair I would have hired Seema long term.  She spent over a month with us about 50 hours/week and was flexible on schedule every week, willing to come super early or stay late at a moments notice.  We still use her whenever we need additional support because our girls miss her!",
