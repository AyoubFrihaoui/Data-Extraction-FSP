If more people were like her, I’m sure there would be a long line at the agency, eager for her services and kindness. From the moment she stepped into my home, I felt blessed. I just want to say that Eunice is a perfect, wonderful person, and you should definitely take a chance on her—you won’t regret it. Thank you so much, Eunice. Bless you!\n",
