Samantha served above and beyond our expectations as our trusted nanny for 6 months. It is also with great sadness that we had to say goodbye as she moves on with her career, in another state. During her tenure as our nanny, Samantha proved daily that she personifies the qualities of trustworthiness, punctuality, patience, flexibility, and a love for children. Your kids will absolutely love her, as will you. We simply cannot say enough to accurately describe our appreciation for Samantha, and we give her our highest endorsement.",
