Lala stood out among the candidates that we interviewed, and we knew that she was the perfect match for our then 5 month old son, who is now starting a full-time 2s program. Lala came to us with over 20 years of experience, and her past families had nothing but wonderful things to say about her.\n\nAs first time parents with demanding jobs, Lala eased our transition back to work. We never questioned leaving our son with her, and trusted that he was in the best care. Lala is honest, reliable, punctual, loving, and has consistently displayed good judgment with anything relating to our son. She communicates with us throughout the day, sending us photos of our son playing and providing updates on his day. Lala and our son sing, play, dance, and learn together - she has been such a positive influence on him, keeping him socially and intellectually engaged throughout the day by reading to him, taking him to music classes and the park, and arranging playdates with his friends.\n\nWe know beyond a doubt that she would be a wonderful addition to any family.

She has been working for our family for the past three and a half years, starting with us when our daughter was three months old and now cares for her (3 years old) and her younger sister (1 year old).  La Fleur is everything you could ask for in a caregiver: loving, responsible, conscientious, active, and our daughters love her.  Both give her huge smiles and hugs as she walks through the door in the morning and are sad to see her go at the end of the day.  La Fleur is outgoing and has made friends for our daughters and arranges frequent play dates in the neighborhood.  She is organized and makes caring for two children look easy!  Our neighbors often stop me to say how lucky we are to have found such a terrific nanny.  We agree she is truly special! ",
