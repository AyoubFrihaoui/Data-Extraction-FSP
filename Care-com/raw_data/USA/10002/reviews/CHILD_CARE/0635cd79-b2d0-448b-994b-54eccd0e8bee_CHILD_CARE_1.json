Jen has cared for our three children who are now grown and is great at every stage from newborn through the teenage years! She is energetic, engages with the kids and is very caring and patient with all ages including newborns. Jen has a wonderful, positive outlook and is a parent herself. She is completely trustworthy, always on time, and goes out of her way to help. She has a positive outlook and attitude that the kids pick up in as well. She is also very safety conscious and I always took comfort in knowing the kids were safe with her out and about in the city.  Jen is seeking part time work and I would be happy to provide a further reference for her!!",
