She comes with unparalleled level of dedication, creativity, fun and knowledge that has been a tremendous help with our family. Specifically, she works with my younger son regarding his speech and communication delays and it has been exactly what he's needed to progress. In addition to her speech and developmental expertise, she's there to remind both my kids that you can have fun and still follow the rules and have good manners.  Ashley really is that perfect support for kids and parents.  In addition, she is punctual, easy to talk with, takes great direction, remains organized and calm, not to mention she is an overall great person to get to know.  Any family or company would be lucky to find some time with Ashley.",
