She's also a good communicator and took direction really well. Overall, she always showed up energized and ready to take on the day with our toddler.  Our daughter adores Alycia and warmed up to her quickly and loved spending time with her, doing crafts and creative activities, exploring the parks and playgrounds in our town, visiting the library and other fun kid centric spaces and going on playdates and lunch/ ice cream dates.  They became close pals - she really made an impact on her. I would highly recommend her to another family.  We all adored her and she really helped our 3 year old develop in some ways that really helped prep her for the preK school environment she now thrives in.",
