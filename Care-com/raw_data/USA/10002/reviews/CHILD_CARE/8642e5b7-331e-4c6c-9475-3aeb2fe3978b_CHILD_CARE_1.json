            "displayText": "It is my pleasure to recommend Zukhra as a nanny. Zukhra worked in our family for one year from May 2014 to April 2015. She worked full time, usually around 40 hours a week.  In addition to taking care of the child, Zukhra did light housekeeping and cooked for the child while she was sleeping during the day. Zukhra is very reliable, she never missed a day of work or was late. If you ask her to get something done, rest assured it will be done. She is extremely trustworthy; I never worried about the safety of my child when she was with Zukhra. Zuhra was always patient with my child and I've never seen her loose her cool or raise her voice. She always found various creative activities, arts and crafts, organized play dates to keep my little girl busy. Zukhra is a kind and goodhearted person and I would recommend her with confidence.",
