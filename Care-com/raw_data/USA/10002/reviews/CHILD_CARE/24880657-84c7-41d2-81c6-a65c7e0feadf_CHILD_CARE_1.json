As soon as Tracy arrived, she started engaging my kids directly in conversation and helped make them feel comfortable right away. They had a great time and have asked about her a few times since the job ended. Although I'd only hired her for childcare, I additionally found that she'd cleaned up in my kitchen and done the dishes. My kids were also proud to show off the pristinely clean kid's room (cleaned with Tracy's help). Tracy is really energetic, experienced, and I'd hire her again in a heartbeat!",
