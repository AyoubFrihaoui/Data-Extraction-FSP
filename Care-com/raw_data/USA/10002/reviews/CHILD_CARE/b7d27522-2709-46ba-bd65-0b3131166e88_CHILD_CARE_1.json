Our son generally takes time to start bonding with new faces, but connected with Kathuna immediately and was very comfortable with her. I was working from home and could hear them laughing together throughout the day. Kathuna is punctual, respects our discipline and schedule for our son, yet very flexible with surroundings and situations. My son still speaks about her after a week. We would love to work with her again!",
