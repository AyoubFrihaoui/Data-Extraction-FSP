We've been so lucky to know our daughter is with someone who is always patient, compassionate, creative, and active with her. It's great to have confidence that our daughter will be socializing, learning, and gaining crucial life and social skills during the toddler years. Our daughter will be going to full-time preschool in September, and we are really sad to be losing Rose, but we know that the next family and kid(s) she works with will be just as lucky as we've been.",
