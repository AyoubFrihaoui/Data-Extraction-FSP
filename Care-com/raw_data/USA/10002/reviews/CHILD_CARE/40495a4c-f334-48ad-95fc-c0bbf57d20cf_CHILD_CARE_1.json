We had some events to go to so I reached out to Abigail.  She was prompt with her response and after a brief exchange we confirmed her to watch our daughter one evening.  She was incredibly professional, she contact me to meet before or have a phone conversation to go over my daughter's routine and just check in about any questions or issues.  When she arrived at the apartment, she immediately engaged with our daughter playing and reading with her such that we were all instantly comfortable.  Her sweetness and ease allowed my husband and I to really enjoy our night out.  I would highly recommend Abigail and if I lived closer would definitely hire her again.",

Upon moving from NYC to Westchester I hired even though she was only available for 10 months because she was so special. Abby is warm, fun, responsible, punctual, playful, flexible and creative. She truly excels at anything she takes on. Our boys thrived under her guidance and we feel so blessed that she was such an important part of our lives even if just for 10 months. She has such a special relationship with each of our boys and brings out the best in them. When I was off to work in the city I didn't have to worry as Abby was there for our children. I also worked from home and Abby was such a joy to be around. She is one in a million!",
