She was responsible for all aspects of his care (feeding, diapering, playing) and adapted to his routine while remaining flexible. Her best quality is her patience and gentleness, which was important to us given our child was starting to form his own opinions but was not yet able to verbally communicate them. In her time with us, she also taught him some Spanish - his third word was agua! We trust her with the safety of our child, and are thankful for her observations which helped make our home more safe for our son.",
