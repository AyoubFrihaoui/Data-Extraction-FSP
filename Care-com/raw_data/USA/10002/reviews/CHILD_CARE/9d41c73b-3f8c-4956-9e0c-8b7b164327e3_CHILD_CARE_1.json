The first time she babysat, I came home to a sleeping baby and a clean home and I admit I cried a little. The second time, my infant son reached for her gleefully. Three kids later, I don't want to let Kiera go! She has nannied for me summers and vacations during her college years and she is ALL of our favorite sitter.  \r\n\r\nKiera is smart, active and her enthusiasm for life carries over to my kids. It has been a privilege to watch her blossom from a sweet teenager to an amazingly accomplished young woman.  She is cultured and artistic. She makes up songs and plays the guitar for the kids. She gets messy with art projects. Working from home as a writer, the sound of her laughing right along with my kids has eased any worry I had about not being \"there\" for them. \r\n\r\nKiera is a member of our family, and we adore her. I will miss her. Any family for whom Kiera works will be extremely lucky.",
