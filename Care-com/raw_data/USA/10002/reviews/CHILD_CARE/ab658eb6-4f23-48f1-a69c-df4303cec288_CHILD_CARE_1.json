She prepared meals for my son and picked him up from school on the days he had to go to his after school activities. She took very good care of my son. Whenever I needed her in a pinch, she always came. She would volunteer to unload the dishwasher or help with laundry, too. My work schedule changed; otherwise, Marcia would still be with us. She's terrific! We all love her.",
