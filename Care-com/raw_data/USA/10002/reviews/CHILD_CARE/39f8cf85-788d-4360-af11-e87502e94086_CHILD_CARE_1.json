She babysat for our 20 month old toddler for 6 nights in a row during a very busy week, including a night we hosted a large party at our house. She is punctual, self sufficient, intuitive, tidy, and brings a wonderful, calm presence to our home. Our toddler LOVES her and was always happy to see her. She made and fed him dinner, bathed him, and did bedtime. She kept him entertained and safe and always left our house tidy. Ashley is smart and has good judgement. She was a wonderful asset and we will hire in the future as often as possible. Truly a gem. I donâ€™t know what we would have done without her. ",
