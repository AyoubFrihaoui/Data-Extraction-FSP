Steffi was exactly what we were looking for, she showed up everyday on time and was even willing to stay a bit longer a few times when we had inexpected things coming up. Steffi was following all our family guidelines, she was caring, reliable, committed and knowledgeable about anything baby related! She bonded with our baby boy quickly and he was always happy and smiling during the time he was with her. We still work with Steffi for baby-sittings and highly recommend her!",
