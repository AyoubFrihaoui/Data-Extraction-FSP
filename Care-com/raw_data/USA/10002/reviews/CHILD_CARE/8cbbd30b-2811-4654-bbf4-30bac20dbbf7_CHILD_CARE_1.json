After meeting with a few candidates, we told Nisa we wanted to extend her an offer and agreed on an hourly rate. She was excited and verbally accepted but told us she wouldn't be able to start for a couple weeks. We asked to speak to her references as one final step but in the meantime agreed that her start date would still be the following Monday. After her references checked out and we extended our final offer with a standard non-binding agreement, and even surprised her by increasing her pay above what we agreed on, she texted me declining stating our agreement was too strict. When my husband tried to call her to talk it through, she responded rudely, said she couldn't speak and then proceeded to ghost the both of us. Now we are back to the drawing board after she led us on for weeks and already passed on several other nannies who are no longer available.",
