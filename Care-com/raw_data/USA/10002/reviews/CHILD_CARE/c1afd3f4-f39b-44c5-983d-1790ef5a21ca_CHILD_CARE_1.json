            "displayText": "My husband, our children and I can't say enough wonderful things about Connie. She is truly an exceptional nanny and also just a warm, loving, kind individual. Connie exemplifies professionalism in many different ways. First, Connie is an incredibly reliable, conscientious person, who not only arrives to work on-time, but early, even in inclement weather. Mornings were often a frenetic time in our house, as we had just moved down from DC into new jobs, new schools and new lives. Connie was instrumental in getting our day off to a good start. She walked in our house every morning at 8:00 AM sharp and every morning it was a great relief. Connie also has a positive and infectious attitude. Every morning she walked into our house with a smile, a hug for the kids, and a plan for the day. She came to work organized with ideas for how to structure the children's day, but she was also flexible when our own plans threw the day for a curve. Connie is ready to go with the flow of the family, or to take charge if the parents are too busy to make plans for the kids. Connie organized play dates, reached out to other nannies in the area, made regular trips to the library and museums, and found ways to engage and enrich our children. Connie was also tremendously helpful, and ready to work with our family as a team. Every day she was ready to pitch in and help around the house even though her primary responsibility was to take care of the children. Connie made use of every available minute of the workday, and helped with running errands (grocery store, post office, children's clothing donations), walking the dog, emptying the dishwasher, doing household laundry, cooking for the children, taking our daughter to routine doctor appointments - you name it. She's one of the hardest workers I've ever met. I also appreciate that Connie reinforced good manners and healthy behavior in our children. Thanks to Connie's consistency, our 4 year-old daughter regularly pleasantly surprises me and others with, excuse me,  please, and thank you. And because Connie is physically active and a healthy eater herself, she instinctively encourages healthy habits in the children. Connie was conscientious about the well-being of both of our kids, but what set her apart was the time and attention she put into making sure that every day for them mattered. She carefully mapped out each day with trips, learning experiences and a healthy mix of the outdoors and downtime, fun and rest, structure and freedom. Within a few weeks of her arrival she had our daughter potty trained and by the time she left she had our daughter reading. She was able to combine the best part of a day of school (structure, learning) with the best parts of the home life (freedom, informality). We frankly did not fully appreciate Connie's rare ability until we worked with other nannies, who seem adept at one or the other, structure or freedom, school or home.\r\nWe recommend her highly!",
