She is as caring as one could hope for, but my highest praises go to her flexibility - I have been in binds on odd days, at odd times, and on short notice - I could never thank her enough for the ways she has bent over backwards time and again to accommodate and to be there for me and for my son.\n\nI am sad to see her go now that I am no longer in need of full time services, and understanding she needs full time employment. Any family would be lucky to take her on.",
