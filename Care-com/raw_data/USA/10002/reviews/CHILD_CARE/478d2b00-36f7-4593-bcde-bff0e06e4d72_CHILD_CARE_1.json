            "originalText": "Jezne is a dream! We travelled early to the NJ area for the holidays and had a few days where we needed childcare coverage for the adults to work. Jezne took care of our crew (ages 7, 5, 5 and 2!) She was fantastic with them, she came so prepared with games, activities, crafts etc. The children easily connected with her sweet and bubbly demeanor and were sooo excited for her to come back the next day. She managed taking all 4 children on a nice walk to the park and took AMAZING pictures of all of them - honestly it was like a holiday photo shoot.  We highly recommend booking with her for date nights or even long term nannying - she was wonderful. Communicative, punctual and brought such great energy to the house.  The children commented \"This was the best baby sitter we've ever had\" haha and they were sad to see her go. If we are ever back in the area we'll be calling Jezne for childcare needs! ",

She was clear and communicative in explaining to me what was happening in real time and proactive. She's trustworthy and cares deeply for the children she works with.

She is SO fun with the kids and every time she comes around she always has creative games and interactive activities for the time she’s watching them. She loves to get the kids moving and acting silly and thinking outside the box, and she is so loving and patient and beyond understanding - having a keen ability to truly get to the level of your beloved little one and understand their own individual needs and interests.\n\nI couldn’t trust someone more than Jezne with my kid’s life. \n\nOh bonus points for the fact that the kids are always asleep and sound in their beds whenever we return from our date nights out!! Seriously, a magician!!! (Even the in laws who watch our kids on the regular can’t ever seem to accomplish this LOL) ",
