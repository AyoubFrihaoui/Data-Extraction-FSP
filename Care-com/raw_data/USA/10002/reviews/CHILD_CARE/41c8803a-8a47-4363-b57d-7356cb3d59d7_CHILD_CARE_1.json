She started when my daughter was just 5 weeks old, and she was experienced and helpful with all aspects of baby care, including calming a baby, diaper changes, playtime, going on walks, supporting a feeding schedule, and keeping a clean and organized space. She was also great with our toddler, 3 years old, who is pretty high energy and whimsical. She is respectful, prompt, easy to communicate with, and generally a pleasure to work with. I highly recommend her for kids of all ages! A great choice. ",

She was instrumental in bringing our shy little covid baby out of her shell. Now our bb sings, dances, and isn't afraid to play with other kids. She would take our little to parks, the zoo, and the museum. If our bb would fall asleep early, Valerie would find other things to do around the house & was extremely proactive. She's even babysat for our nephews from out of town. We were super sad to see her go when she moved, but so excited for her new journey! She even had a play date at the park with our little one when she was back in town for the holidays. Definitely consider her forever family. Any family would be lucky to have her :)",
