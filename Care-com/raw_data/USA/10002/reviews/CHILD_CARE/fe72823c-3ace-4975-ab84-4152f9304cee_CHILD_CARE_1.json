            "displayText": "Icy is a loving, caring, energetic nanny!  She has over 20+ years of experience caring for babies and young children. She has 5 adult children of her own (2 of them are twin girls), and she brings that experience and knowledge with her to work everyday. She has been wonderful helping our son develop physically, mentally and emotionally and she has helped achieve his development milestones. She is great about taking him on walks, to the park, and to get fresh air during the day (socially distanced and based on the our comfort level). She adores children and babies and gets on the floor to play with him and read him books.  We moved to TX but brought her with us for 1 month because we did not want to lose her. We honestly would keep her on longer here, but she needs to get back to be close to her family.  She will be back in Brooklyn the week of April 12.  She also scheduled her Covid vaccination for the week of April 12.",
