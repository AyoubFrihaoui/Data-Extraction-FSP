            "displayText": "I have know Katie since she was about 7. She has been our neighbor and friend ever since. When Katie was little she came over almost every day to play with my son who was less than a year old. When my daughter was born, she would hold her for hours. By the time Katie was nine, I hired her as a mother's helper. I always trusted her with my children. She played with them, did crafts with them and taught them age appropriate skills. She was always patient and understanding with my autistic son. He was an extremely difficult child and she never got frustrated. She was our babysitter until she went away to college. Part of the reason that she studied special education was because of her experience with my son. I would trust her with even the most difficult child. She is always engaged with the children she watches.  Having a child with special needs is difficult, Katie has been a blessing to my family.",
