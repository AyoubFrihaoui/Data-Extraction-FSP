Let me start by saying she is very warm and nurturing, my daughter took to her immediately! I could tell within the first few minutes watching their interaction that she genuinely enjoys being around children which put my nerves at ease. Throughout the day, she send pictures and videos to show me how my little one is doing, a detail I greatly appreciated. My daughter loves hearing that Mabel is coming over and starts jumping with joy when she arrives. They play together (she doesn't just turn the TV on all night THANK GOODNESS) and by the time I come home, her room is clean and she's tucked into bed. I highly highly recommend her! ",
