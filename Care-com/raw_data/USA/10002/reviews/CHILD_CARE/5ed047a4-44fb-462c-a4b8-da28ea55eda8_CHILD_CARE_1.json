We're first time parents of a 2.5 month old, and had never had anyone but her grandparents watch her so we were super nervous even though I was working from home. Our baby had been really fussy and having trouble napping all week. Lisa put us at ease right away, was very attentive to our daughter, got her to nap so she was a happy baby and showed us new tricks to soothe and entertain her that we've been using and calling \"Lisa's tummy time trick\" and \"Lisa's bouncy nap method\". I hope she'll be available next time we need to hire someone! ",
