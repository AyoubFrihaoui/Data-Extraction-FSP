They became fast friends and she brought so much delight, creativity and compassion to their time together. Her patience, integration of teaching techniques and thoughtful communication with both kiddo and parents was an outstanding addition to our family. We trusted her completely to do outings driving in her car, solo evenings babysitting and shared time at home that was not disruptive for concurrent home office remote work. She proactively communicated, helped support family health requests, kept the house tidy and brought the utmost integrity to all interactions. We will miss her dearly as her care is irreplaceable! You would be lucky to have her support. ",
