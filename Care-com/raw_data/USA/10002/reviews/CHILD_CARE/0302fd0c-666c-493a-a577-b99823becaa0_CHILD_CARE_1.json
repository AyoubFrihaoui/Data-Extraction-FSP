            "originalText": "Sammy is what I refer to as a \"super nanny\". We've worked with her many times, and she is so fantastic with our two kids (2 years and an infant). I think you see the difference between a \"super nanny\" and other babysitters in a number of ways - she comes up with activities specific to their ages and works with them on certain abilities. She is able to get them to want to behave well - it's hard to describe, but my son always wants to do what she asks him to, and is happier after she comes and babysits. Both of our kids adore her and my husband and I trust her as well as like her as a person (she is fantastic). She also always goes the extra mile with the kids, and is sure to send us pictures while we are out (which I greatly appreciate).",

Sam also tailors her activities to their ages and interests, ensuring both children's development needs are met. As a result of this the kids absolutely adore her! They feel safe and comfortable with her, and they always look forward to her visits. We truly appreciate the positive and enriching experiences Sam provides for our children.
