            "displayText": "Juliana was our steady, part time nanny for four years on the UWS. She has become an important person to our son and to our family which includes a French Bulldog. Juliana bonded immediately with J. when she met him in 2012. She knew exactly how to engage with a curious, physical 3 year old toddler. She started with us when J. was three years old and stayed with us until December 2016 when she needed to go abroad for a year. Juliana is extremely responsible, a fantastic communicator, a professional and all of J.'s friends loved her as much as he did. Her responsibilities included pick up, taking him to classes, arranging play dates (she's very social), going out to the museums or other activities, serving dinner (usually prepared by me or ordered in), homework and bath time. J. is a strongly opinionated child, and she always handled him firmly, calmly and with warmth and love (and laughter).  Any family would be lucky to have Juliana work with them. ",
