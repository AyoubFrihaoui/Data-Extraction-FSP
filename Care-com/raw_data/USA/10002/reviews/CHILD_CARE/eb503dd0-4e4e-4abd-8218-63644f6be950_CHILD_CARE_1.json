She has more than 20 years of experience taking care of babies and toddlers. Her experience shows in the way she interacts with children. She goes above and beyond in her day to day responsibilities and is willing to learn new activities when requested. She reads books, sings songs, teaches my kid to build with blocks and Legos to name a few activities. She keeps my kid engaged throughout the day and I know the baby is in great hands with Alisa. I highly recommend hiring Alisa as a sitter!",
