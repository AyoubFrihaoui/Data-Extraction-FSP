Christae always found ways to entertain our daughter who is very busy and has a short attention span, we were very impressed. She was also very focused on the health and well-being of our child and would only spend time with other kids or go outside if she felt it was in the best interest of our daughter. When our little one would fuss, Christae showed endless amounts of patience and she was also very respectful of my husband and I working from home. \r\n\r\nIf you are lucky enough to hire Christae, you will experience her warmth from day 1. I hope she finds a family as wonderful as she is. We would have continued to have Christae as part of our family if we weren't leaving the city. We already miss her.",
