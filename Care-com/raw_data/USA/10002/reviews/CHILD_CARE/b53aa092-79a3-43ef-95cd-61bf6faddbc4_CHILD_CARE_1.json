I’ve seen her with newborns all the way up to tweens, and she is just amazing with all ages. I cannot recommend Daba enough. Our whole family adores her, and so does everyone who meets her. ",

She currently fills in for us when we have childcare gaps and has been a lifesaver in this respect. Daba is warm and caring. She has a playful and gentle touch and is better at eliciting  our daughters’ cooperation than we are. Her genuine affection for our daughters is abundantly apparent, as is their affection for her. Daba has also had very helpful suggestions about how to relieve symptoms and soothe them when sick. I highly recommend Daba without the slightest reservations.\n",
