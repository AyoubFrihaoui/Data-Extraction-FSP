            "displayText": "Emma nannied part-time for our family for a year and a half until we moved to CT. I have two toddlers (1.5 and 3.5) who can be a lot, and Emma took them on in stride. The children were always learning something: new songs and dances, numbers and letter sounds for our 1.5 yo, and early reading, sight words and early mathematics for our 3.5 yo. Our 3.5 yo is top of his class in preschool, and I truly credit her for that! Fun crafts and activities, visiting parks, museums and classes in the city, coordinating and hosting play dates, even attending doctor's appointments. She helped potty-train our 1.5 yo with the utmost patience and love and helped our 3.5 yo navigate separation anxiety when he started summer camp. Emma is wonderful, a caring, patient, intelligent caregiver with a deep love for taking care of children. We are so grateful that we had the opportunity to work with her.",
