            "originalText": "Martha was our nanny for 6 years and was with us through the birth and raising of our 3 kids (now 8, 5 and 2). The children love her and we still visit her today. She’s reliable and trustworthy. She knows everything about children. She is proactive with coordinating educational activities at the libraries, setting up playdates and fostering a loving environment. I knew the second I left the door I didn’t have to worry and trusted her to even take the kids on public transportation throughout the city as needed. She’s the only one that would get my picky 5 year old to eat healthy. Healthy and nutritious living is super important to her. She taught me so much about being a mom and really helped me along my journey. I would hire her again and trust her wholeheartedly.  ",
