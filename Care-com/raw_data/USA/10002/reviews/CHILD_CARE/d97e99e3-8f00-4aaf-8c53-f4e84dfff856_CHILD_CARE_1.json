            "displayText": "Our family just arrived in New York. As our kids only speak French, I posted a job on care.com for a fluent French and fluent English and received tens of applications, interviewed many as well. When my husband and I met Nogaye, we immediately knew she would be a great caregiver and we were right. We asked her right away to care for our two little boys, aged 3 months and 2 years old as we felt she was so experienced and professional. Nogaye is a very smart woman on whom you can rely to handle your house as if it was hers, discreet but in charge. She immediately won over the two little ones, and this although the smallest one requested a lot of attention. She clearly knows about children psychology and newborn nursering. She would ask me about our customs and immediately fit in. Always super punctual and available, even when we asked her for long days when we were moving. Singing little songs to the newborn, this one could not stop smiling. Definitely a great nanny ! Our family will come over and help with the kids, this is why we have to let Nogaye go. Don't miss her - she is one of a kind.",

I can   not remember many times over the years that she was not able to come to work. Many times when she was not feeling well she would still be at our house taking care of our kids.
