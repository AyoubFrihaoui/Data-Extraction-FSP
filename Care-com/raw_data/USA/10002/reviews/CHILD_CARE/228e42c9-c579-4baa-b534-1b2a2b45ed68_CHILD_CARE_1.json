From the moment I first met Irene I felt I could relax knowing that my daughter was being cared for by someone who has over a decade of caregiving experience and a wonderful warm presence. Irene is incredibly experienced, practical, energetic, and flexible- often coming early or staying late depending on the needs of our family. She also was amazing with our animals - taking our 50lb, basically untrained lab mix on walks daily without batting an eye.   She treated our daughter like her own child, helping us to select age-appropriate toys for her, researching the best teethers/toys/clothes as she grew. She also kept our home so neat, organizing rooms, doing laundry and cleaning the kitchen - she likes to stay busy and with both of us working very long hours, her going above and beyond like that made all the difference. We are so lucky to have had her incredibly capable hands with our family! ",
