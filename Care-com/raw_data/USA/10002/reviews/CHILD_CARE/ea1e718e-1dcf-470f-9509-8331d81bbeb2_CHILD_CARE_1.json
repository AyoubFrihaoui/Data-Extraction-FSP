            "originalText": "Natela was a literal God send. She has a heart of gold she actually cares about your child reaching their milestones and being cared for and loved. It’s not just a job to her. She was so knowledgeable in her approach on getting my daughter to reach her milestones. She was hired for my 2 month old daughter and my 2 year old son that doesn’t take to anyone loved her as well. She would set up Montessori style play on the table or floor for him in the morning so him and I could do it while I gave him his breakfast. She took care of both my kids as if they were her own but she was professional and never did anything without consulting me even though I trusted her and gave her the green light to do anything she felt was right. She taught me so much in developing my 2 month old daughter’s motor skills, massaged her to help with her tummy aches, helped me give her baths, did tummy time, gently introduced her to learn how to roll on her tummy at 3 months. She cared about me and my well being and rest just as much which was so appreciated since I didn’t have family around. She instantly felt like family and I would have kept her forever if she didn’t move. Anyone that hires her next will be very lucky to have her. Thank you so much Natela. ♥️",

Our family feels that Natela was an absolute blessing because she was not only an incredible nanny but a wonderful person. She is always punctual and willing to go above and beyond to meet G's needs. She worked with G daily on building independence and meeting developmental goals. Natela was always looking for new toys and activities to do with G to learn and be creative. Natela is also very intuitive to G's schedule. G looked forward to her time with Natela each day and would run to her stroller to get ready for her arrival. Any family would be lucky to have Natela caring for their children and we will be forever grateful to know her.",
