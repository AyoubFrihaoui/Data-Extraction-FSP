She's always punctual or early, never in a rush to leave, and you can really tell that childcare is her passion - she's super energetic with our infant, talking and reading and playing pretty much nonstop during her wake windows. She's also totally happy to cuddle her for her contact naps (the little one doesn't like to sleep alone yet). She has the recommended tDAP and flu vaccines to protect infants, is happy to wear a mask due to the pandemic, and I feel completely confident leaving my baby with her. I know she treats her every bit as well and is every bit as engaged with her as if she were her own child.",
