She helps me once a week and is willing to do anything I need (postpartum Douala) which is to mostly care for my 2 month old so I can get projects done or attend to some self care. Her demeanor is patient and kind and she is incredibly easy to get along with. Both my two month old AND my cat warmed to her immediately. Highly recommend!",
