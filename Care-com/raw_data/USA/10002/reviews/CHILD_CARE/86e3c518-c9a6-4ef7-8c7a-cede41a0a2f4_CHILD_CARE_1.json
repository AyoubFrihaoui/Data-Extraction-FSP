            "displayText": "Michelle interviewed quite well. Made thoughtful suggestions of interactive toys to help our child develop. She was very approachable and personable. Michelle was punctual. Sadly, all of those things presented were very surface based. She exhibited impatient behavior with our child. She spent a tremendous amount of time on her cell phone. She had expectations of being paid for a vacation that would've occurred roughly 6 weeks after her start date. And to make matters worse, she provided our family a 24 hour notice of her departure. During the interview process she was equally thrilled about the exact needs of our family as it pertained to duties/days/hours. It was very important for us to ensure that our Nanny was comfortable with a part-time 20 hour position. That in turn was exactly what Michelle stated the needs of her family were. She advised us on a Wednesday that her last day would be Thursday because she had a job interview Friday. She also stated that she may be able to assist us the following Monday/Tuesday and she would let us know. She left our home Thursday on her last day in a very awkward manner. She never followed up to advise if she could help us the following week due to her short notice. She never reached out to us after we promptly sent her payment to provide an update. Michelle essentially walked away from the job she never seemed fully committed to. I would not recommend utilizing her as your future nanny or babysitter. In the end she did us a favor. The temperament she had with our child, the way she exited the job position, and her expectations would've resulted in her dismissal. Please beware of her interview skills, and approachability. We were very excited about her knowledge and experience. Sadly, it was an awful facade.",
