She has a calm and loving personality, she is reliable and hardworking, the kids love her, and she is so organized, cleans up everything after the kids go to bed, and extremely detail oriented. She always asks before she gives the kids a snack, or even which toothpaste to use. She texts us if anything comes up. We love using her for date night and she has even helped us out last minute when other sitters cancel on us. I would recommend her 100%...just don't take her too much because we can't live without her :)",
