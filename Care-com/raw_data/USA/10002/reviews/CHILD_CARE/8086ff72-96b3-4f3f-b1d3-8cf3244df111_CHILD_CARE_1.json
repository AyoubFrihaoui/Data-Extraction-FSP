            "displayText": "Sophie is magic. There are no other words for the work she does with children. She nannied for my two children, currently 1 and 4.5, for over a year and I can't say enough wonderful things about her, truly. People like Sophie are one in a million, and I don't know if I'll ever be able to find someone like her again. She is always on time, brings the most creative, wonderful activities for my kids, sings to them, teaches them dances, songs, games, new skills, and truly shows them the most loving care you could imagine. I feel like she was a gift from the heavens for me. There is not a kinder, more professional, more thoughtful person I've met in my life. I wish so much that she hadn't moved to New York! I would have her over every day if I could. Bonus: she even brought our fish, Rainbow Pancakes, back from the brink of death, with a fin treatment and regular fish tank cleaning and inspection. The care that she provides for all living things goes above and beyond. We miss you Sophie!",
