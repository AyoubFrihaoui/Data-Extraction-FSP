For the past year, Andriela has become an integral part of our family, caring for our daughter since she was just six months old. It has been a truly wonderful experience, and we are incredibly grateful for her presence in our lives.\n\nAndriela is remarkably responsible and trustworthy, qualities that are paramount for any caregiver. She has fostered a deep bond with our daughter, who has grown to love and rely on her. Andrielaâ€™s ability to engage in playtime and keep our daughter consistently entertained is a testament to her dedication and creativity. She knows how to create a nurturing environment where our child can thrive.\n\nAdditionally, Andriela is fantastic with our two golden retrievers, seamlessly integrating them into her daily routine. She treats them as part of the family, ensuring they receive love, attention, and exercise alongside our daughter. \n\nAs a police officer and my husband a fireman, our schedules are often unpredictable. Andriela has shown incredible adaptability, accommodating our changing needs with grace and ease. Her flexibility has provided us with peace of mind, knowing our daughter is in such capable hands. In addition we have a 2 month old and andriela has been absolutely amazing taking care of both children.\n\nIn summary, Andriela is the epitome of a perfect babysitter. We cannot express how fortunate we feel to have had her in our home. I have no doubt that she will be an asset to any family fortunate enough to welcome her.\n",
