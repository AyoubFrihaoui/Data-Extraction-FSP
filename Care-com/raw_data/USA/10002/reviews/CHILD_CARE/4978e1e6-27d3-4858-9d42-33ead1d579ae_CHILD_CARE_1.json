She was an incredible source of support when my son was found to be dairy intolerant, and she helped me navigate early parenthood in the midst of exhaustion. Now, with two toddlers, she's equally expert, but in different ways. She's taught them to count and sing the alphabet; they go on adventures to museums and parks; if they master using a potty, it will be thanks to her. \n\nFran is fun and kind.

She is a saint! In addition, she is very friendly and made lots of friends with other parents and nannies in our building and at the park. As a result our daughter had play dates and friends all around our neighborhood! As a working Mom, it was such a treat to have Fran send me pictures of her as well as updates on her naps, their activities and how their day is going. When our daughter was diagnosed with a speech delay, Fran jumped right in and actively participated in her therapy and the follow up tasks we were given as a family. Our daughter's therapists praised her efforts to us often. She is very reliable and punctual and worked with our crazy work schedules, making our lives so much easier on every level.   She would be a welcome addition to any family.",
