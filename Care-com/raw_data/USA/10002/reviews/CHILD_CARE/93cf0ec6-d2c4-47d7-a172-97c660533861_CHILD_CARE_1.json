He made significant progress during this time learning from scratch the alphabet, counting to 20, over 100 words and putting his first 2-3 words sentences together. Also, Camille taught him good manners (e.g. being patient while waiting, not throwing things or poking) and layered the foundation for developing life lasting good habits (e.g. washing hands after using potty, brushing teeth after meals). Very energetic and familiar with the best activities for children NYC has to offer, Camille took our son daily to Central Park, Nolan Library, Met Museum, the playgrounds in the neighborhood, within the distance limits we felt comfortable. Camille made helpful suggestions on options for classes to enroll our son and she took him to attend these. Proactive, she also arranged for playdates. While in-door she creatively organized the time between reading books, play, art and crafts activities and needed time-out. Although cooking was an optional duty, she regularly cooked organic vegetarian food for our son to help with transition to solid foods. Camille is always punctual and never called in-sick. The expense budget she managed wisely, making very inspired selections of books, art supplies, toys, clothes and healthy foods. She will give us helpful reminders of the items low in stock or buy them if we run out. She will keep us updated during the day with pictures and text messages and also she will keep a written log of the daily activities. Camille values her independence as a caregiver and teacher to facilitate the guidance of the child she cares for through different stages of development. Please feel free to contact us with any questions.     \n\nThank you,\nOana",
