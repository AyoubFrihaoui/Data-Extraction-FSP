What we loved most about Delta was how she actively engaged our son by talking, playing, and laughing with him throughout the day. She helped encourage his development, challenged him to start crawling and reach other milestones, set up playdates, helped get him on a schedule, took him to the library and other classes, and was very interactive with him. Most importantly, our son loved her. He was always smiling and happy when they were together. I think you will find her to be a welcome addition to your family.",
