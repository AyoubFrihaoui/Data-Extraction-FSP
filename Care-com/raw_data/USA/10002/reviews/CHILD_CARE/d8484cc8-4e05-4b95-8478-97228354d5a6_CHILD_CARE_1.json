My kids and I traveled from LA to NY to visit & she was watching my 3 year old while I got to enjoy a night out for once, my 13 year old decided to stay in as well & ended up having a tummy ache, Malaya ordered her ginger ale, tums & all sorts of good stuff to help with her tummy ache. As my 3 year old slept, she then kept my 13 year old company & watched a movie. At the end of the night she waited for me & asked me how my night went, gave me an update on the kids. So extremely grateful for her, the kids & I loved her. Especially my 13 year old! Malaya will be my go to sitter every visit to NY. Highly recommend her & you will be so happy with her. Not to mention she's a really talented artist.",
