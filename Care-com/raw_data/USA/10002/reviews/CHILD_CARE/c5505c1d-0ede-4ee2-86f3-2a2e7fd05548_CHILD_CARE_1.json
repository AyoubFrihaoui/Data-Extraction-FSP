            "displayText": "Hiring Salwa full-time was one of the best decisions we have ever made. We knew we needed some help with our 8-month old baby boy, but she offers so much more than exceptional childcare. Salwa is loving, attentive and active. Over the course of the last several months she has engaged with our son in English, French and Arabic, read lots of books with him and has even helped teach him his first words. She plays with him nonstop and takes him out for walks along the waterfront. She has traveled with us to weddings and family functions and is never on her phone in front of the baby. She makes fresh baby food for our infant, makes meals for us since we work from home, does laundry and cleans the apartment, and even helps play with and walk our energetic puppy. We are so grateful for the amazing care she took of not just our son but our entire family and our home. We're so devastated that she can't move out with us out of state. The next Brooklyn family to find her will be incredibly lucky.",

She is always finding age-appropriate activities and singing songs. She truly loves little babies and was always with her on the floor and engaged. She always never sat still. When my daughter was napping, Salwa would clean, do dishes, prepare meals. She is never idle. Though she doesn't advertise this way she is really a home helper. As my daughter grew, Salwa also took her to activities around town and was always paying attention to what she was into (puzzles, etc.) and coming up with activities that aided her development. She has many years of experience; she came highly recommended by another family and I know that whoever hires here will be happy that they welcomed her into their home and their lives. We love her!",
