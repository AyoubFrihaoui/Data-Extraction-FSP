He seemed wonderful while we interacted - he was prompt in his responses, and seemed very eager.  \r\nThe day that he was supposed to come - he never did.  He did text my friend later that night saying something about losing his phone in the subway.  The next day, he was supposed to come again -- radio silence. I've texted him, emailed, and messaged him through care.com (I was really getting worried) --- but no response.  I do hope that you are OK, Michael, and that you would have the decency next time to at least give families a heads up that you won't be coming in.",

They felt he was super fun to be with who would play with them, have a conversation with them on various topics, and keep them busy and active. He watched our children in an indoor play area and an outdoor park. Both occasions were super fun for our children. Michael is reliable, punctual, and flexible about working around any issues that come along. I highly recommend Michael!",
