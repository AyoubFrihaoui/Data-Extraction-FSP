She's worked with us full-time for the past 5(ish) months. Vicki is calm, she is patient, and she approaches the job with good humor and fun. She doesn't just pass the hours with my daughter, but makes an effort to share meaningful experiences with her. I often get photos in the middle of the day of them taking a walk in the Botanic Garden, doing story time at the local library, cruising a museum, etc... If my daughter is grumpy from teething or generally just having a rough day, Vicki hardly seems fazed. She rolls with the moods like an absolute pro. My baby has formed a happy attachment to her and looks forward to seeing her every day. Unfortunately we're soon to be moving out of town and will lose out on working with Vicki in the future, but our loss will be your gain.",
