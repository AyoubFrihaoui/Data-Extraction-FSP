She LOVED playing and spending time with Rachel, who is such a natural with children, we couldn't recommend her enough to others looking for child care. She was engaging with our daughter, took her on walks, played with her, talked with her...Rachel really understands how to interact with children, and genuinely enjoys it. The only disappointment is that she is not based in CA, which is where we are currently living...we are looking forward to using her again when we are in NY next! Rachel is a great communicator, extremely responsible, and understands relational dynamics with children, she is so easy and enjoyable to be around. We are so grateful to Rachel for the care, kindness, presence and engagement she gave our daughter during the week she looked after her while we were working. Thank you for everything Rachel! ",
