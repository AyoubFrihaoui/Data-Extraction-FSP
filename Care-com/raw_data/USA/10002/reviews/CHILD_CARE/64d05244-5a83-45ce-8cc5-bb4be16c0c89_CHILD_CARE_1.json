This was our first experience with a nanny and we couldn't have asked for anything more. Emily is extremely personable, creative and passionate about children.  She formed a very special bond with our son immediately. In just four months of caring for him, she taught him sign language, yoga and expanded his vocabulary.  She graciously stayed later from time to time when needed and went above and beyond what was expected of her. We were comforted in knowing that our son was under such great care. It is our absolute pleasure to recommend Emily to anyone and everyone who will listen!",
