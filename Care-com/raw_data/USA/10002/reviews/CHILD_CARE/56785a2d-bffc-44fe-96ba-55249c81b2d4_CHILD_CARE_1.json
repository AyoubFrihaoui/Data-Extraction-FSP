If they both didn’t need to be in school now, we never would have given her up. She is both so loving and so skillful with kids, even at challenging ages (such as when ours were 2 and 4 and a lot to handle). She is creative in both her activities and problem solving and has a charisma the kids love. We always felt they were in good hands with her, and our older son is now fluent in Spanish from the time they’ve spent together. We can’t recommend Gilma highly enough, she is truly special.",
