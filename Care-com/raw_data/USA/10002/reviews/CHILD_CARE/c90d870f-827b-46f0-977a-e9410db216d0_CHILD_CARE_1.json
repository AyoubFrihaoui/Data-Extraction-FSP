Nowadays, I am more frequently thanked for bringing Molly into people's lives than I am for any of my own life achievements! (I'm not bitter.)\r\n\r\nIt is a joy to recommend Molly, a warm, bubbly individual with a rare mixture of intelligence, sense of humor and compassionate kindness beloved by all -- especially children. Be it walks in the park, music or reading, Molly will devise some unique combination of activities to spark creativity and joy in any child, regardless of temperament or age. I know because I've seen it!",
