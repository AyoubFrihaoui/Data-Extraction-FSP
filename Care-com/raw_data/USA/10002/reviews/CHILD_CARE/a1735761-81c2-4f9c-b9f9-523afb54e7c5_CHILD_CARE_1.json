She has been taking care of my two boys, aged 18 months and 4 years old, for about a year now, and she is absolutely amazing. From day one, she's been reliable, caring, and so nurturing.\nShe has such a great way of connecting with the kids — they're always excited to see her and have a blast with her. Whether it's playtime, storytime, or helping with daily routines, she brings so much fun and joy into their lives. She's not only young and energetic but also incredibly responsible and thoughtful. It’s such a relief knowing that my boys are in such great hands.\nI highly recommend Krystal to anyone looking for someone who genuinely loves kids and is dedicated to providing a safe, loving, and fun environment for them. My kids adore her, and I’m so grateful to have found such a fantastic sitter!",
