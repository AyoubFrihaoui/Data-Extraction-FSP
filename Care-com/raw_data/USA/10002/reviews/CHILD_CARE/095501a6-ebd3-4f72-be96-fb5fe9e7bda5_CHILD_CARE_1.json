She avoids using \"no\", instead explains the whys-hows of everyday life. Creates teaching moments out of.. reading, cooking, drawing, singing. \r\n\r\n2) Figures out how to make my life easy. Vany is always a step ahead of me.  She thought my boys to cover their faces when they cough, say please & thank you, potty trained my 2yo without me having to lift a finger (she even found a potty & underwear & sent me links), let's me know when she thinks my son is ready for a nap schedule change, the list goes on!\r\n\r\n3) good EQ/discreet + hard-working/on-time\r\n4) TONS of Experience (10yrs working w families of 4, 3, & 2 kids respectively!)  + TONS of energy. Vany is 33yo and has the most amazing positive energy. With her you don't have to sacrifice experience for energy. We love her!",
