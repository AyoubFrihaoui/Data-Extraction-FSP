Shatir cared for my 2 children the summer of 2019, My Wife and I were neighbors of Shatir’s family for sometime so we hired Shatir to help us out during a very difficult time in our lives &amp; she has been tremendously great with the children and family. We love her like she is apart of the family and I know that you will be pleased with her incredible work with your children. Shatir is very timely, the children always stayed on track with their summer programs because of that, she was very attentive with the children and over achieves task. Unfortunately we moved away after covid so that great help &amp; dedication is missed, but fortunately during our family NYC trips we find times to see one another and the children always love when they get to spend that time with her. Overall Shatir is a perfect candidate for you and your family.",
