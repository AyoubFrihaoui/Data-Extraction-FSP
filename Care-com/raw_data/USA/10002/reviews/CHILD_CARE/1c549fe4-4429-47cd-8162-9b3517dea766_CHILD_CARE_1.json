She came one day on a trial basis and then failed to come back as agreed. When she called she indicated for the first time that she had another job and had to discuss her schedule and resigning from the other family she was working for. She told me she'd call me back and didn't. When I followed up with her she told me she could not quit and come to work for us. She wasted several hours of my time, was inconsiderate about the fact that when I hired her I stopped interviewing other candidates and she really left me in a bind. For these reasons I would not recommend her even for an interview. I believe she deserves zero stars. ",
