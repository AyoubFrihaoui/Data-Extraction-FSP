            "displayText": "Melissa was our full-time nanny for 4 years. She started when our youngest son M was only 3 mos old and our oldest son was almost 3 years old. We love her dearly and any family would be lucky to have her! Melissa is kind, loving, empathetic, genuine, and extremely responsible and dependable. We were always confident that our children were in the best of hands with her. When M was a baby, she read, talked with him, sang, got down on the floor and played with him, took him to the park, playground, and activities, and did laundry/cooking/clean up/baths.  She helped with drop off/pickup when he started school and cared for both kids during vacations and sick days. When COVID hit, Melissa was a true partner, helping us juggle childcare, online/hybrid learning, different pick up/drop offs, and the kids' days off as we worked from home. Her calm, steady, warm demeanor was invaluable to us. The kids adore her! We highly recommend Melissa without reservations. Please reach out with any questions.",

As a parent, there is no better feeling than knowing your child is both safe and happy. One thing that really stands out about Melissa is that she approaches kids with a genuine desire to understand what makes them unique and therefore how to best care for them as individuals.
