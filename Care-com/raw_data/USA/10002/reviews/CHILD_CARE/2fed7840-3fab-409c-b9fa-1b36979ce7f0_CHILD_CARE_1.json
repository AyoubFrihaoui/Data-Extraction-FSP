She was able to get him to sleep in a timely manner throughout the night with no issues, and eat with no fuss. She left the house the way we found it. Toni was respectful and personable. We work nights, and she’s been our go-to person each time my husband and I are both scheduled. She’s even been able to respond last minute! Such a life saver! I would definitely hire her again. ",
