She’s prompt, responsive and flexible if there’s a slight change of plans. More importantly, she is always amazing with my kids - which is rare to have such consistency! From day I, Milena connected with the boys by accommodating their personalities and leaning into their interests. She’s patient, calm and in control.When it’s rainy, I’ll find her playing happily with the kids, and very rarely resorting to screen time. She helps prepare meals and cleans up! Milena is a blessing one rarely finds. ",
