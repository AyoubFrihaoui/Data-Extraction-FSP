            "displayText": "Tara started off fine but then turned to be extremely opinionated and would argue endlessly instead of following parent's instructions. she was responsible for one child and one day insisted she wanted to take my other child out to the playground after bringing the first one back which I appreciated, on return she asked for an extra hours worth of money because she took my other child out, even though it was only one child at a time and the rate for 2 children is 25 not 40. Her argument was that the other child required more effort so she wanted more money for taking him alone. by going out i mean the playground across my apartment for 30 minutes. Once I was in the room on a call and just because she was in the other room with both children present, not engaging with them she asked for an extra hours worth of money, again the rate for 2 children is $25 not $40 but I gave her $40 anyway.  It seems like she doesn't let an opportunity go to ask for more money. she also made it a point to repeatedly tell me about the time the other babysitter was  minutes late and she had to bring both kids upstairs from the main entrance, she was 9 minutes late. \r\nIn the last week before she suddenly quit, she cancelled last minute twice saying she had to take care of her friends kids, even though i had said i really needed her and then sent me a text saying she's accepted another job, without any notice, knowing full well  that my new job was starting the next day and that both my children are special needs. \r\nHer constant advice was to keep the child outdoors and keep giving him water, which is not a bad thing but is not the ONLY thing  children with autism need. I had a list of engaging games for home but she never used them and only wanted to take him outside, even if he had been awake all night and was tired and after me telling her don't take him out if he's tired. \r\nI am glad that she is out of our house and lives and I would not recommend or hire her again.",
