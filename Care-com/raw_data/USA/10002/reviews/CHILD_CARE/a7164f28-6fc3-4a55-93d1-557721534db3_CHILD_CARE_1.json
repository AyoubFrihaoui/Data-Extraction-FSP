She has learned and grown alot! Prior to that she was hired to help my wife get the boys prepared and ready for school while my wife was pregnant, since then she has been one of my wife's most helpful sitters, staying mornings with our little girl, taking on date night shifts with all 3 (our two rowdy boys included). She is wonderful and we highly recommend her. We will continue to use her as well for weekend shifts and date nights as all 3 of our children are now attending school/ daycare. We Highly recommend her ♥️",
