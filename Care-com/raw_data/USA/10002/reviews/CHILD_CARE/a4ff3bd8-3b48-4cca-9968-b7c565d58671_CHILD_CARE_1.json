            "originalText": "I am writing to highly recommend Yordie as a nanny for your family. She has been an invaluable part of our lives for the past 10 months, providing exceptional care for our four-year-old son in a nanny share arrangement with another family. Sadly, our needs have changed, and I hope she finds a family who adores her just as much as we have.\n\nShe is intuitive and can quickly grasp what each child needs from their caregiver. For example, my son is an only child who has an outgoing personality, and she makes it a priority to set up plenty of playdates and opportunities for him to connect with his classmates after school. She has been central to orchestrating after-school playgroups and I can tell that the children love her, while many of their parents have approached me to tell me how wonderful she is.\n\nIn addition to her caregiving skills, Yordie has demonstrated a remarkable ability to juggle the needs and schedules of two families seamlessly. She maintains clear and open communication with all involved parties, ensuring that both families are kept informed. She handles the logistics of the nanny share with professionalism and efficiency, making sure that both children receive equal attention, care, and opportunities for growth. \n\nYordie is not only reliable and trustworthy but also compassionate and nurturing. She creates a warm and supportive environment where our son is engaged, happy, and encouraged to explore the world around him. She goes above and beyond to tailor activities and experiences to our son's interests and developmental needs. For example, she noticed that some of his friends were able to write their own names, but he wasn’t. So, she immediately created worksheets to work with him trace letters.\n\nAs parents, we have complete peace of mind knowing that our son is with Yordie. She was also flexible with her schedule, often staying late or coming to help at a moment’s notice when my son was sick and needed to be picked up from school, and for that, we are deeply grateful. She forged a kind of bond with our family that we will always cherish, and we wholeheartedly recommend her to any family seeking a dedicated, compassionate, and skilled nanny.",
