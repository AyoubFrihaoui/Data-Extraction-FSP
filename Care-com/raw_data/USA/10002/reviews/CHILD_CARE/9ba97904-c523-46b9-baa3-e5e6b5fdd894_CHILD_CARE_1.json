            "displayText": "Kayme has made my transition back to work SO much easier. I truly feel like we hit the jack pot having Kayme as our Nanny. Kayme has a very calming presence that our entire family has benefited from. In addition to taking remarkable care of my two boys, Kayme has also helped to keep my apartment tidy (something I can't even do with two kids!).  My oldest son who is 4 is very attached to Kayme in a short amount of time. As a parent, it is the best feeling in the world to walk into your home after a day at work and hear your children laughing and happy. Kayme has also given me great advice and suggestions for our two kids. Our family loves having Kayme around. I don't know what we would do without her!! She is very dependable, professional, knowledgeable, and loving. She's everything we wanted in a Nanny and more! If you have further questions please feel free to contact me! Thank you Kayme for everything you do for our family.",
