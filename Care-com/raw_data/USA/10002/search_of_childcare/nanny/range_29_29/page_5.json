I am interested in baby sitting part time as I complete my studies. My availability ranges per semester right now however, during my school breaks I have extensive availability. I am specifically interested in working during the summer of 2023 (June-August). During those times specifically I'm sure I can accommodate any child care needs and work on a more consistent schedule. I have a vast array of child care experience. Most recently, I worked for the past 2 years at an early intervention center for toddlers ages 2-3 with autism. I have been a camp counselor to children with specials needs ages 6-15. I have also baby sat children from 5 months to 12 years old. My responsibilities have ranged from diaper changes and feeding, homework help, meal preparation, playing indoors and outdoors, and night time routines.",

I have been working with young children through the most formative years of their lives for about 4-5 years now. I've worked with ages newborn-grade school age. Working with kids of a wide age range, l've honed many different skills and techniques. I can also help with light housekeeping, after school activities, outdoor activities, crafts, meal prep etc. I have worked with families and daycares (I'm currently a nanny). I would be pleased to continue using my creativity, patience, communication skills, and problem solving skills to help kids grow. It is my sincerest hope that you will consider me.

I am very passionate about caring for children in a way that allows them to play, learn, let off steam, and say the funniest things in the process. I was raised in Brooklyn and moved back after graduating Wesleyan University. I bring this experience to my caregiving, as I know how to carve a home and safe space in a big city. I have been a caregiver and tutor for children of all ages for 10 years. For example, I've co-stewarded an outdoors camp in Park Slope for children ages 1 to 5, babysat a sweet 8-month-old infant, and was a tutor / babysitter for a very curious 11-year-old with ADHD who was adjusting to a mixture of remote and in-person schooling. My teaching style is tailored to each child that I work with, taking special note of their learning style, when they need gentle encouragement, and when they may need a break.
