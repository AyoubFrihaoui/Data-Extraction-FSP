Going to the park and taking walks around the city is something I love to do. Art was my major in high school so I am also very decorative and creative when it comes to school projects.

I'm currently in law school and am looking for a side gig to support myself. \n\nI started working with kids when I was a teenager. I was a counselor at summer camps and youth groups in my area for about 4 years. More recently my babysitting has been for my family members, primarily my cousin with 3 kids.\n\nIn my spare time, I like to play volleyball, cook, bake, and spend time with family and friends. I also love to travel and learn about different cultures.\n\nOne thing you should know about me is I will always follow any instructions given to a tee! I'm detail oriented and love to go the extra mile.\n\nMy skills include getting the kids active and outside, assisting with school work, and most of all, patience.",
