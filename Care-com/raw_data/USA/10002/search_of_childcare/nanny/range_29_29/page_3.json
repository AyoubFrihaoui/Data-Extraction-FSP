I'm a caring, fun, responsible sitter with ~6 years of experience, a Wilderness First Responder certification (which entails medical training including CPR), and a decent amount of flexibility for scheduling and tasks/chores.\n\nI helped care for young cousins as I grew up, then babysat a family friend's child weekly for several years. I miss having kids in my life and hope to help care for yours! I see kids as whole people -- as individuals -- even at a young age, and I'm adaptable in my care based on your child's needs/personality.\n\nI have a B. A. in Environmental Studies and English and have worked as a researcher, tutor, climate justice organizer, and (most recently) pastry chef, as well as my babysitting work. In my free time, I'm a reader, cook, beginner soccer player, ASL student, and blacksmith's apprentice.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to reach out!!",

Education is important to me and those values have allowed me to be in the top of my class, and I enjoyed bringing education and extra curriculum activities together which is what I often do whilst in the UK. I enjoyed mentoring student-athletes of Watford football clubs and I was a basketball coach for London United U16 boys team and the U14 girls team during my breaks.\n\n I also tutored and mentor several kids throughout my time in college, and organized a plethora of community service events.",

I love kids so I have been babysitting since I was 14. I have been a nanny, mommy's helper, and babysitter to children ranging from newborns to teens. I also spent the past summer as a camp counselor at an overnight camp in New Hampshire for 6 weeks! I can make simple meals such as pasta, rice, or anything pre-packaged but I am a great baker! I have no problem with housekeeping and laundry, I'm a bit of a neat freak so cleaning up is in my nature. I nannied throughout college and found it to be the best job to have while in school!",
