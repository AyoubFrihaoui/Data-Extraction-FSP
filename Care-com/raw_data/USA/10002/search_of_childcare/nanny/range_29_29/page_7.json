My cousin's youngest was diagnosed with Autism at 2 and a half, so I'm familiar with caring for a child with some special needs. Most families over my years of child care I have taken care of since their children were born, so I'm very comfortable with infants as well as older children. I've used babysitting as supplemental income over the years, so though I have never been a nanny, I am very experienced.",

I prepared their bottles with pumped breast milk and occasionally formula, took them on daily walks, and helped choose toys and books for their enrichment as myself and their parents are enthusiastic about early childhood education. \n\nI also nannied an 10-year-old child with disabilities- Deafness, vision impairment, SPD, and autism.

My love for children and passion for taking care of the elderly has become my second nature. As much as I enjoy nurturing and caring for these individuals, I also have a bundle of joy of my own that brings immense happiness to my life. My experience in caregiving has taught me patience, empathy, and the ability to provide compassionate support to those in need. A little fun fact about me is that I am currently pursuing my education in nursing, as it aligns with my desire to help and serve others. The fulfillment that comes from being able to make a positive impact on someone's life is what motivates me every day. With my skills, experience, and genuine love for caregiving, I strive to continue making a difference in people's lives through my work as a nanny, home health aide, and soon-to-be nurse.",
