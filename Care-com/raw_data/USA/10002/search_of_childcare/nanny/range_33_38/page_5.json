Their endless curiosity, boundless energy, and sweet imaginations make every day an adventure. There's nothing more heartwarming than seeing the world through their eyes, and I love being a part of their journey as they grow and discover new things.\n\nI'm super flexible and always ready to lend a hand-whether that's with homework, making yummy snacks, tidying up, or just sharing some laughs together. Safety is really important to me, and while I'm working on getting my CPR certification, I've learned so much from my grandma, who's a medical practitioner, so you can trust your little ones are in safe hands.\n\nPlus, I'm a huge fan of storytime! I love bringing books to life and making reading a magical part of the day. I can't wait to meet your kiddos and create some wonderful memories together!\n\nLooking forward to chatting soon",

I've cared for babies under a year and up to 5 years old. \nComing from a large family, I have a deep passion for working with children. I enjoy staying active through daily walks, engaging in circle time, reading books, and exploring arts and crafts. In addition to childcare, I can assist with light housekeeping, meal preparation, and running errands.\n\nI am committed to getting to know each child, fostering their learning through play, and supporting their development in essential life skills.\n\nI look forward to meeting you and your little one!",

I've worked with children since 2015 and currently teach at Wise Wonder NYC. I also spent two years as a nanny, gaining extensive experience with newborns, toddlers, and school-aged kids. I can assist with tummy time, sleep training, and developmental milestones, and I've attended swimming classes with newborns to 3-year-olds to support early motor skills.\n\nI have experience caring for children with special needs and have worked alongside physical therapists (PT), occupational therapists (OT), and speech-language pathologists (SLP) to support motor, sensory, and communication development. I'm First Aid certified, ensuring your child's safety is my top priority.\n\nAs a Spanish tutor, I make learning fun with stories, songs, and hands-on activities. I'm also launching weekend Spanish courses for toddlers, where little ones can explore the language through play in a warm environment.",

I have always had a house full of babies/toddlers and children for many years and dedicated most of my time caring for them. I have also cared for many of my friends infants as well. I am very attentive, high energy, fun, creative and extremely responsible punctual and reliable! My experience goes back 28 years! Newborns are my absolute love! I also LOVE dogs and cats and would not mind at all if you needed help with your pets as well at no extra cost. After all they are our kids too! :) I can provide you with plenty of references if that is something that you would need. I know its difficult finding someone reliable, but with me there would be no worries! I am as down to earth as you can get. I hope you are too!",

I started my working career by coaching gymnastics for 3 years and then going into college I nannied a family for 4 years of my undergrad degree as well as another family for a couple of months into the pandemic. Each family I work for is so unique and special. I find it my personal business to assimilate the best way I can so it makes leaving your child with me much easier.
