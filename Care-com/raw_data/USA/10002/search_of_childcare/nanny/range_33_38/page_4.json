(I miss the pure joy of working with children too much!! \n\nI have an outstanding reputation among my lovely, often high-profile clientele for being flexible, level-headed, and highly responsible. I excel at quickly being able to reflect and respect the individual preferences, nutritional goals, and developmental philosophies of any family - leaving parents feeling that their child is in the best hands possible in their absence. \n\nAs for the kids, they will tell you Miss Andrea tells the BEST stories, knows the funniest games, and is a crafting wizard! :) \n\nAvailable for consulting, playroom organizing, temp and travel only.",

What started as a way to pay for college quickly turned into my passion. I love being around kids, supporting their growth, and becoming a helpful part of a family's daily life.\n\nI have a bachelor's degree in psychology from Hunter University, which has given me a strong understanding of child development and behavior. Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of working with three families for 6+ years each. I'm currently with my third long-term family, but as their children have grown, I'm now looking for a new family to support-either full-time or part-time. \n\nI have paid experience caring for children from 5 months to 13 years old. Beyond childcare, I'm happy to help with cooking, laundry, cleaning, deep organizing, pet care, errands, and any other tasks to support your family's needs.

I have also cared for patients from 70s-90s that have included extensive personal home care.\nIn my spare time, I like to cook & spend time in nature with my rescue dogs (hike, camp, swim).\nI was a lifeguard for 7 years.
