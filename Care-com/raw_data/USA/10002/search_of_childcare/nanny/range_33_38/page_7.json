In addition, I have four years of experience working with infants aged 3 months- children aged 12+ in classroom, daycare, summer camp, and home settings. I've spent the past 2 years nannying and I genuinely look forward to going to work every day.

From a young age, I've always had a passion for children.\nI graduated from the University of Arizona with a Bachelors in Communication, and I also got my Masters degree in Organizational Leadership and Change. After college, I was working in higher education and recently hopped out to nanny.\nThroughout college I was a nanny full time to 2 wonderful families. I also worked for other families on the side as needed. After college I decided to hop into the corporate world/ higher education, but I've learned working with children is what makes me happy.\nCurrently I am looking to assist with date nights or weekend care.\nI can provide multiple references if need be.\nI am CPR and Babysitter certified, and willing to go through additional certifications to make you feel comfortable.\nI look forward to hearing from you!",

It's about creating a safe space and openly communicating to create the best environment for all.\n\nI'm available for weekend and holiday travel nannying, and have experience in both the U. S. and abroad. If this sounds like it aligns with your needs, let's chat to see if we'd be a good fit! I look forward to hearing from you!\n\nStarting rate is $35/hour or $450/day for travel.\n\nI am also a movement based educator (Pilates) and have experience in mindfulness.",

I have a full-time job, but work in the non-profit/education field so have always looked to nannying for supplemental income whenever I need some spending money. I am originally from California and have a huge family (most of whom are still in CA), so I miss being around kids often and view nannying as a win win for both me and the families I sit for! I have experience with children ranging from 4 weeks old to 16 years old. I enjoy baking, cooking, working out, reading, and exploring new places. I can't wait to meet your family!",

I currently have families I work with occasionally for date nights etc. I have worked in house cleaning and done solo jobs in homes. I am currently an assistant, I would say I have amazing management skills, communication skills, organizational skills etc. I am willing to learn anything new; I am a hands-on learner. When it comes to food I will base it off the parents open to learning any recipes, if not we free style!
