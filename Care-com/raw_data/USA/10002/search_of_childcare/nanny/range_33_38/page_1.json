I moved to New York City two months ago from San Francisco where I consistently babysat for families in my neighborhood. For my full time remote job, I work as a consultant in biotech after graduating from UC Berkley in 2021 with a degree in molecular environmental biology. \n\nI'm originally from Sacramento, California where I gained most of my experience working with children as a camp counselor. I spent five summers working full-time with children ages 3 to 12 years old and engaging them in activities, games and imagination based adventures. I've also babysit infants, toddlers, and kids since I was 14 years old.\n\nIn addition, I am comfortable tutoring children of all ages through high school. I was my high school valedictorian and have maintained a solid understanding of high school curriculum as I have tutored my younger brothers and their friends. Please feel free to reach out - thank you!",

I'm a nanny currently living in Lower Manhattan and seeking a full-time, live-out position.\n\nI double-majored in Spanish and Economics and after graduation moved to Murcia, Spain to teach English to children ages 3-12. I started babysitting at 13, was an au pair in Madrid in 2019, and spent the last year nannying for a wonderful family in Charleston, SC.\n\nI have experience with children of all ages and I am comfortable caring for siblings.\nI emphasize routine building, fostering responsibility, kindness, and adaptability. I love keeping things creative and engaging for kids and advocate for a screen-free environment, focusing on enriching activities away from TVs and tablets. I'm pet-friendly, tidy, organized, and happy to assist with household chores. \n\nI'd love to discuss how I can support your family.
