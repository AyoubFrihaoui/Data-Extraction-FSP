I have served in several positions pertaining to child and youth engagement, including as a nanny, camp counselor, mentor, and day camp director. I always ensure that the children I work with feel uplifted and supported, and am take care to cultivate creative, interactive activities and opportunities for engagement, whether through crafts, guitar, reading, games, and outdoor play. Most recently, I served as a longterm nanny (first full-time, then part-time) for three years for a private household on the Upper East Side with two children ages 2 and 4 at start. They found me through Care. com, actually! I also spent two years as a babysitter for two children, aged six weeks and four years to start, while studying at Bard College.

I have worked with children of all ages from newborn to 15 years. \n\nMy childcare philosophy is that a child learns best by experience. That is why I believe that it is crucial to expose children to the world around them through exploration activities. Any activity that takes a child out into the world can become a learning experience. For younger children, it could be socialization or learning to behave appropriately in public settings. For older children, it could be learning how to budget at the grocery store or how to determine the appropriate tip for a service employee. Every activity or errand can become a learning experience for children of any age whether that's a day trip to a museum or just a quick trip to the store. I strongly believe that the best time to teach a child is when the child doesn't realize they're learning.",

I am a passionate, empathetic & patient young woman who I hope you will trust with your childcare. I love to be actively involved in playtime activities, and safety is always the top priority! \n\nBabysitting experience includes providing childcare for various families in my neighborhood, both on a consistent basis & intermittently, with children as young as 2 months. Additional experience includes teaching dance classes for children ages ranging from 2-10. I have experience with infants, as well as with children with special needs & caring for twins. \n\nI am comfortable with some light meal prep/ cooking and cleaning, and open to school and/or extracurricular activity pickups, as well as homework help. I have my own car as well, so transportation will be no problem!",
