I became an assistant Montessori early childhood education teacher at 16 years old for an internship. After that, I've tutored and held two summer camp jobs, as well as having a paid internship teaching ESL students. I graduated from university and usually babysat or was a nanny to earn extra cash when I wasn't teaching. I now work in learning and development, but my contract ended. While I'm looking for a new full time job with health benefits, I would love to babysit full time! From summer camps to teaching a classroom of 33 preschoolers, I've done everything!",

My child is also picky with food but she was patient with introducing new foods to him and reporting back how he responded every day. She let me know upfront that she had a back injury but was able to do all of this with a wonderful positive attitude.
