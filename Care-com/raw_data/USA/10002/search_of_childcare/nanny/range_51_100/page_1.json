My training includes CPR, college classes in childhood behavior, and 22 years of being the oldest of 5! I have babysat children from a wide range of diverse backgrounds and age groups. I'm great at keeping children engaged with fun, age-appropriate activities. I can help with homework, playtime, meal prep, and bedtime routines. I'm also comfortable with light household tasks and pet care. Families that I have worked with appreciate my reliability, punctuality, and friendliness. I am always open to any specific guidelines that you have and will help you meet your family's needs. I will be glad to provide references upon request. I look forward to assisting your family.",

She handled everything with such care, patience, and reliability, making our evenings so much smoother.\n\nThe girls absolutely adored her, and I always felt at ease knowing they were in such capable hands. She was not only punctual and organized but also genuinely engaged with them—she taught them how to make bread, set up a windowsill garden for one of my girls, and held regular karaoke sessions. I truly wish she had stayed in Maryland so she could continue helping out with our family. Any parent looking for a trustworthy, caring, and responsible sitter would be lucky to have her!",
