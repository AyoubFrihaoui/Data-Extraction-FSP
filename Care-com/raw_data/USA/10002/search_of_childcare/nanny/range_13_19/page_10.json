My time with watching children started when I was 16 years old as a babysitter then shortly after started as a gymnastics coach for toddlers. I have experience with multiple children at every age and I have also watched them overnight while the parents are on vacation. During this time, I had to continue with their everyday schedules, which included prepping them and taking them to school, after school activities, preparing meals, as well as helping them with their homework. I have spent over a year as a nanny in New York and am comfortable taking the train with kids as well as maneuvering around the city. While babysitting, I enjoy being active, teaching them new things, and sharing new experiences with them. I would love to create new memories with your little ones! Please reach out for any additional information you may need. Thank you!",

With five years of babysitting experience under my belt, I currently serve as an aftercare aide at a charter school in Hoboken, where I interact with many wonderful children each day. I have a diverse background in caring for kids, from newborns up to 13 years old, and I also help with homework when needed.\n\nI love to keep the kids engaged and active by introducing a variety of enjoyable activities. Some of my favorites include coloring, freeze dance, cookie decorating, storytime, and different arts and crafts projects. Cooking and baking are also passions of mine, and I take pride in my patience and strong communication skills.\n\nDuring the weekdays, I'm available after my job, which lasts from 2 p.m. to 6 PM, and I attend college classes in the mornings. I am completely free on Saturdays and Sundays. I would be excited about the chance to work with your family, so if you believe I'd be a good match, please don't hesitate to reach out!",

For teenagers, I would collaborate to make meals, help with homework, and accompany them to various activities around the city. I am a student at NYU and can tutor all subjects for grades K-8, as well as any high school humanities courses. I am willing to help out with household chores, laundry, and light errands as needed. I have over 2 years of experience as an assistant for a speech pathologist specializing in early childhood development; this experience included helping to design and assemble a sensory gym for children on the neurodivergent spectrum.
