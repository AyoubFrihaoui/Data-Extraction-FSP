I consider myself compassionate, caring, passionate, open-minded, easygoing, responsible and educated. I enjoy spending time with my friends going out and engaging in outdoor activities around the city and other places. I have a passion for cooking I enjoy baking, painting, and going on solo nature walks.\n\nI've been working with children since 2019. My journey began as a childcare assistant at an at-home daycare, where I cared for children aged 10 months to 12 years of age, including those slightly on the spectrum and hyperactive. I later became more passionate about working with children over the years I've gained extensive experience with children of various ages and am confident in caring for multiple children simultaneously. I am truly passionate about contributing knowledge to their development and find great fulfillment in being a part of their growth.",
