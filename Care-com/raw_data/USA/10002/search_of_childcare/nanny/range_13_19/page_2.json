I graduated from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo last year with a degree in Sociology and Media Arts. I nannied and tutored for several different families on and off throughout high school and college. Since graduating, I have been working in eldercare and for a pet care company. I found eldercare to be very rewarding, but I miss working with children and am eager to reconnect with that joy. My responsibilities in past childcare roles included ensuring safety, maintaining hygiene, cooking, cleaning, driving, playing, tutoring, and more. I also have special needs experience. I believe I make a great babysitter because I focus on making personal connections with the children I care for. This not only helps me better understand and meet their needs but also fosters trust and friendship. I'm excited to meet caring families and contribute my skills and experience in any way I can!",

One of my goals for my degree is to work with children who have a communication disorder. I love working with children because they are tomorrows future and I love being a part of a community that helps children prosper into their fullest potential. Over a 6 year span I have work with over 100 children ranging from infants to teenagers. Some activities I've done are STEM lessons, tutoring, lessons on healthy habits and hygiene, setting weekly goals, extracurricular activities such arts and crafts, dancing, acting and trips. Most importantly social emotional learning I feel that it is essential for children to know that its okay to talk and express their feelings in a well manner. One thing about me is that I'm a kid at heart and I feel you're never too old to have fun. Hope to hear from you soon.",

I also coached tennis clinics, which has given me a lot of experience working with children at all ages. The kids I teach and help assist vary from the ages 2-15. The experience I have gained from my past jobs have taught me a lot about how to teach kids and make them feel comfortable away from their parents during classes. From this I have worked for my boss and watched his kids, whether it is at home, his house, or taking them to the pool or classes. I am very artistic and love arts and crafts with kids!",

I understand the array of personalities that kids have and am confident I have the patience and experience to care for them all.

I have worked with many families in my town and was hired by a local church to babysit for functions they had where there were numerous children at one time. The families I babysat for relied on me to transport kids to and from different activities. I helped with meal prep, light cleaning, bedtime and morning routines, plus overnights, and travel nannying. I am dependable, detail oriented, trustworthy, caring, and organized.
