For 3 years, I taught a music class for kids ages 18 months-7 years old. Last summer, I worked twice a week for a family with a 2-year-old boy and a 4-month-old girl. I can help with Light Housekeeping, Laundry, Cooking, Crafts, and Swimming Supervision. I also am willing and able to help with any school work. I am very energetic and will do whatever I can to give your kids a fun experience. I love playing games, watching movies & tv, going for walks, and having dance parties.

Additionally, as a rising senior at the University of Pennsylvania's Nursing school, I am well accustomed to fast, high-pressure environments and can provide care beyond cooking, cleaning, and other tasks. Overall, I am a fun, bubbly person who would love to look after your little one(s) and help in any way I can!",

My journey in caregiving began through babysitting roles, where I discovered my natural ability to connect with children and make a positive impact on their lives.\n\nI believe in fostering a nurturing environment that encourages creativity and imagination while maintaining a structured routine. Communication with parents is essential, and I strive to keep them informed about their child's day and any matters that arise. I adapt my communication style to their preferred method, whether it's verbal updates at pickup or regular texts or phone calls.\n\nAs for household rules, I follow the parents' lead and ensure consistency in their child's routine. Playtime is an integral part of a child's development, and I enjoy engaging them in various activities, from board games and educational games that promote learning to technology-based games and apps.",
