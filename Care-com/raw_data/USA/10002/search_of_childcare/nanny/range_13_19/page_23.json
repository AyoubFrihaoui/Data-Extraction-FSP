I am very skilled in supervising and caring for babies and toddlers and older children and I have a strong understanding of the general abilities and interests of children in these age groups. I prefer reading, educational games and imaginative play in favor of television, and other forms of electronic media. I enjoy spending time outdoors and attending community activities and classes and I am always looking for opportunities to infuse art and learning into everyday activities. I am upbeat, energetic and thrive in an active, service-oriented environment. I am also passionate about using my life to make a meaningful contribution to others. As my references will attest, I have a special gift when it comes to demonstrating compassion and making children feel valued and purposeful.",

I started working as a full time Nanny with a 4-year-old while attending college at the Fashion Institute of Technology. I was able to balance a full time childcare job working afternoons into the early AM hours, alongside my schooling. The child was very energetic, thoughtful, and artistic. I loved working with them for 3 years. In 2014, I began my freelance photography career and babysat part time for a family. They had 7-year-old twins. I would pick them up from school, help them with homework, engage in playtime, reading, arts and crafts. I worked with them until 2016. I began teaching photography and visual storytelling at a non for profit in The Bronx in 2016. I spent 7 years teaching photography to HS and MS students. Recently, I've been spending most of my time helping my sister with her newborn baby (my nephew). My style of childcare is patient, enthusiastic, artistic, and empathetic!",

I love making kids happy, and learning what they like and their dislikes. It is always a good feeling to put a smile on a child's face.

Now I've been nannying for around 2 years and I've worked in a couple early education schools. I've seen how to take care of kids as a big group as well as one on one. As a nanny, I'm the type of nanny who can tell you every single little thing about my time taking care of your children! I understand that children just want to be loved and seen, even more when they're having a bad day. I'm currently typically fully booked throughout the day with my main nanny family but I'm always open to babysit in the evening! They are also going on vacation for most of May so I'll be available for temporary full time jobs, please reach out if that's what your family needs!",

I have been working with the youth population since I was 14 years old. My first job was at the Children's Brooklyn Museum, working as an animal trainer/educator's assistant. I quickly learned that I enjoyed teaching and working with children. After obtaining my undergrad degree, I climbed my way up the childcare ladder as a homework help volunteer to a full-time youth Program Director. I have had the pleasure of designing and overseeing 4 summer camp programs serving over 150 students in the course of 5 years. For years I have been approved by DOE and DYCD to coordinate and organize some of the best & safest trips, making some of the most memorable moments. Over the years I mastered designing programs that create memories students will never forget. I enjoy spending time with children and adding to their growth, it is one of my many gifts.",
