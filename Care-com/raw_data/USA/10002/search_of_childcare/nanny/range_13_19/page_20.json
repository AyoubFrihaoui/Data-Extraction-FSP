I'm based in Brooklyn and am open to part time or full time work, or the occasional weekend or weeknight gig. I have experience with children ranging from 3 months to ages 12+ and have worked with families with up to 5 kids. I'm experienced with babysitting in New York and love taking kids to museums and playgrounds as well as planning fun art projects and other activities. \n\nA bit about myself-I grew up in New Hampshire and am the oldest of three kids (and 5 dogs)! I'm comfortable with dogs, cats, and any other kind of pets and always happy to help take care of them as well. I completed my Bachelor's degree at Tulane University in Art History and Architecture in 2020 and went on to work for an art advisor while living in Bozeman, Montana, then moved to New York to work for an art book publisher as an editorial assistant. I now focus on freelance work and childcare. Please feel free to reach out with any questions!",
