While most of my experience with kids is school aged and above I have worked with infants and toddlers on a babysitter basis. I love to be outdoors and would have no problem taking your children out to a park or for a walk to get some fresh air! I can help families with housework, errand running, and meal prep/cooking.",

I'm very outgoing and I also drive as well, so if I ever needed to pick up the kids it wouldn't be a problem. I love doing arts and crafts with kids, baking with them, taking them to the park, and forming connections with families. I have two cats just incase anyone has any allergies! and i'm fully vaccinated if that's a concern as well :)\n\nI'd describe my personality as outgoing, fun, and caring.",

When it comes to household rules, I follow the parents' lead, ensuring a consistent and harmonious environment for the child.\n\nMy love for outdoor sports, games, and activities makes playtime both fun and enriching. I'm comfortable caring for one child at a time and have experience with various age groups, from infants to preteens. I worked mostly with preteens as a cheer coach at my old highschool (mcclancy), which I loved and would like to continue caring for others.\n\nTo ensure the safety and well-being of the children in my care, I have undergone CPR training.
