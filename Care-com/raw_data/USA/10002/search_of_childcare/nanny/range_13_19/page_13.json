I started babysitting at the age of 14 and was fortunate to nanny for the same wonderful family throughout high school and college, providing consistent care for almost 7 years. For the past 6 years, I've combined my love for children with creativity, working with kids on photoshoots for a children's fashion brand.\n\nGrowing up in a large family full of kiddos, I've always enjoyed being around children. I love learning, planning fun activities, being active outdoors, and getting creative with arts and crafts. My excellent organizational and communication skills help me provide the best care for your little ones. I'm also happy to assist with housework, cooking meals, and helping with homework. Looking forward to meeting you and your family!",

My work schedule has me out by 3 p.m. Monday - Friday making me available to help out with any after school care or weekend support you need! In the past I've coached 5th/6th and 7th/8th grade rec league basketball for 2 seasons and helped at a field hockey summer day camp for 4 years while on the varsity team. I am CPR certified and I've had a nannying job each summer for the past 6 years and have seen it all. I also have 3 dogs, a cat and a 16 yrs old sister back home so I can handle any type of animal and attitude! I've lived in the city for the past 4 years and currently reside in Brooklyn, Let me know if you have any questions for me!",
