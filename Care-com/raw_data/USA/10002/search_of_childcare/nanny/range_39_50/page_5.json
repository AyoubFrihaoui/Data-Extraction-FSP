I currently volunteer at a shelter tutoring kids in anything they are struggling with. \n\nI grew up in Lancaster, PA & went to college at Boston U where I studied mechanical engineering. When I got my job as an SE being totally remote, I decided to move to NYC & absolutely love it here. In my free time you can find me going to concerts, cheffing it up in the kitchen, or going out to dinner with friends. Some of my hobbies include playing piano, painting, and running.

I was a double major and an honors student, and in 2018, I traveled to Cordoba, Spain to study Spanish. I have been nannying for 12 years, and have experience with everything from infants to teenagers. My mom was a youth swim instructor and has been a teacher my entire life, of everything from second grade to high school. I learned a lot over the years watching her work and helping her in her classroom. In high school, I was a volunteer coach every year for our local youth basketball league. In 2020, I moved to southern Mexico to teach English to second and third-graders. I am near-fluent in Spanish and also fully vaxxed! I am a California native, but am now living in NYC. I would love to ease some of the childcare strain being placed on families during these trying times. I am a very active person: I love swimming and sports and just playing outside. I would love to help you and have fun with your kids!",

I have taken care of infants to teenagers while living out and living in. I have also traveled domestically and internationally with families. I'm very patient, reliable, fun and most of all I still have a little bit of kid inside of me, which I think makes for the best kind of nanny. \n\nI love to read, listen to music, take road trips, shop for interesting finds, and do board games and puzzles.

I attended Hunter College and received my master's degree in Childhood Education and I am NYC certified. I am very familiar and confident with working with children aging from newborn to middle school years. I love playing, going outside, reading, and giving all my attention to the child. I also can help with any academic needs. Working with children. I have the skills to help provide the social and emotional needs necessary for growth. Before my teaching career started I worked for many families, with children of all ages, as a caregiver. I love to cook and clean so if those are requirements I would gladly accept.
