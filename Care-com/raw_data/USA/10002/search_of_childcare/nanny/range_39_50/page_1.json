With a passion for nurturing children and the great outdoors, I bring a unique blend of experience and skills to provide exceptional care. Over the past two years, I have cared for and mentored youth, developing a deep understanding of their needs. I have spent the last two years as a Teaching Artist for several nonprofits, guiding and mentoring middle school to high school students. This diverse experience has allowed me to connect with children of all ages and backgrounds, fostering their social and creative development. With 15 years of wilderness training and first aid survival work, I am well-prepared to ensure their safety and well-being. Whether it's an outdoor adventure or an imaginative indoor creative play-time, I take immense joy in finding ways to connect children with the wonders of the world around them.",

I started a babysitting business at 15 where I cared for up to 4 children at a time. I have experiencing nannying a family of 3 for a few years (ages 3, 5 and 11) and then nannied a family with a newborn! \nMy nephew, who I also take care of often, has cerebral palsy and a few other medical complexities. I am very comfortable in these spaces.\nI have experience with working with children of all ages, children with specific eating protocol (feeding tubes, bottles, your specific toddler meals!) and children with disabilities or other special needs to be cared for! I also have experience as an English teacher and tutor. Let me know if you would like to jump on a call to chat through my experiences!\n\nTake care :)\n- Syd",
