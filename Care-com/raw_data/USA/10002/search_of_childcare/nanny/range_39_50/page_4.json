I follow the parents' preferred communication method and am respectful of their wishes and guidelines.\n\nMy strengths as a babysitter include school pick up and home settling in ie cleaning lunchboxes, school bag, as well as meal preparation (salmon, chicken, veggies, pasta, etc), homework help, and playtime and creativity for younger kids whether that taking them to the park, library, reading with them, taking them to extra curricular",

After receiving my masters in early childhood/ special education I still babysat part time. From there, I taught physical education and health for ages 2 years old - 15 years from 2018-2021 on Long Island. Then taught a 2nd grade general education inclusion classroom in 2021-2022. I am currently taking a break from teaching and looking to nanny once again. I have relocated into Manhattan and am looking to start right away. I created my own curriculum while teaching 2nd grade and I would love to continue to teach while also exploring life skills to your child. I am passionate about education and the safety of children everywhere.",

Because my dad was working in another country for the first three years of their lives, I became very comfortable caring for small children through my moms coaching. When I was 12 years old I began babysitting. Throughout my life I have babysat for countless families with children aging from three months to 13 years old. The most kids I have babysat for at once was four under the age of eight. My mom is a special education teacher so when I was 13 years old I began volunteering with her at an organization called A Place To Be where I worked with children and adults who had down syndrome. I love kids and would be thrilled with any opportunity to be a caregiver!",

Beyond art, I find joy in a range of interests, including hiking, sports, and reading. I also love animals and have a dog of my own. While taking classes, I'm seeking a wonderful family to assist. My past experiences include serving as a personal assistant and nanny during my time in Los Angeles five years ago, where I cared for a 12-year-old girl. Additionally, I've regularly provided babysitting services for former volleyball coaches and aided in caring for the children of the Duke University assistant wrestling coach, whose kids were 2yrs old and 5 months old. I've also happily taken on dog and house-sitting responsibilities for my former boss whenever her family went out of town or required extra assistance.",
