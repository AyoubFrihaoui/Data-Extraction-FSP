I've been working as a nanny in New York for the past 10 years with amazing families in Brooklyn, babysitting kids from different age groups (4 months old to 13 years old) Experiences were very different because each child had different character and was living different stages, but they surprised me with their ingenious way of looking at the world and learn, as well as I learned from them. I truly enjoyed taking care of them. I consider myself a very friendly and easy going person. If you are interested please let me know and we could schedule an appointment to meet in person and talk a little more. Looking forward for your reply. Thanks in advance!!",

Most recently, I spent three wonderful years nannying for a family in Tribeca, where I cared for their two children from infancy through toddlerhood. I supported them through major milestones, from daily routines to family vacations, and developed a strong bond with the whole family.\n\nI'm reliable, organized, and passionate about creating a warm, nurturing environment where kids can thrive. Whether it's planning engaging activities, helping with school routines, or ensuring everything runs smoothly, I truly love what I do. With the family I worked for recently relocating, I'm now excited to find a new family to support.\n\nIf you're looking for someone experienced, compassionate, and dependable, I'd love to connect!",

I am hardworking, diligent, patient, caring, nurturing and well-organized. With the kids, I love making arts and crafts, reading books, setting up age appropriate play dates, baking/cooking with them and for them, love being outdoors - having picnics, going to parks, playgrounds, the library and/or any outdoor activities. A plus is I also drive and upon request can bring the kids to the zoo, museums or even visits to the dentist or doctor. I also offer homework help, and help with any other school projects. I am here as your support, follow on your disciplining strategies, and help you along the way on your child's growth and development.",

I handle all aspects of childcare, including feeding, diaper changes, nap time, light housekeeping, and planning fun, educational activities. I always bring a positive attitude and energy to my work, ensuring that both children and families feel supported and happy.\nMy priority is to always ensure a safe and nurturing environment for children while following parents' routines and guidelines. I am CPR and First Aid certified, a non-smoker, and a confident driver. I have a own car. In addition, I am comfortable around pets and happy to assist with caring for them as well.\nI'm located in Palisades Park, NJ, and would love to discuss how I can support your family. Please feel free to reach out!\nThank you, \nEsra",

Childcare is my passion, I am one of the oldest of 150 cousins and 10 siblings! I have over 8 years of babysitting, summer camp, nannying, and classroom experience with children of all ages, with a special focus on 0-5. I would describe my style of childcare as aligned with gentle parenting, I try to foster autonomy, self-expression, and emotional intelligence while still being gentle yet firm with boundaries and safety. I am vaccinated, mask with high filtration respirators indoors and in outdoor crowded spaces, test regularly, and only share air with people who do the same. I am happy to discuss COVID precautions to protect you and your family. References available.\n\nI am available for one-time or recurring babysitting, pet sitting, and tutoring jobs in NYC. I pride myself on my open communication and I look forward to making your experience as smooth and stress-free as possible.",
