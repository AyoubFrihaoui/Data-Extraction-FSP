I'm a reliable childcare provider with over a decade of experience (I started babysitting when I was 9!) caring for children of all ages. I'm enthusiastic about supporting families and helping children learn and grow.\n\nI pride myself on my patient and calm nature, which helps me connect with children and create a nurturing environment. Don't worry, I still like to have lots of fun! \n\nI have lots of experience with kids of all ages, but especially with infants and toddlers. I also have plenty of experience with multiple kids. In addition to this experience, I grew up with two siblings VERY close in age, and consider myself an expert compromise finder. Communication is always key for me!\n\nI'm excited to bring my skills and experience to your family and be a positive influence in your child's life.",
