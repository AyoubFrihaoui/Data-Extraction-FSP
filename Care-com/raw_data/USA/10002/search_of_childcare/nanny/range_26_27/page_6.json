                    "experienceSummary": "Hi there, my name is Cassandra and I am an energetic 23-year-old MA graduate! I am currently located in Brooklyn, NY as I finish my Fulbright research project.\n\nI am looking for part-time opportunities in New York City. I have experience caring for toddlers and children up to 12 years old, and my focus is on giving your child(ren) a safe, active, and creative space! I love doing crafts, getting outdoors, and going on occasional fun outings. I am firm but kind, and will work with you on any challenges your child may come to.\n\nI have taken the Red Cross Babysitting course which includes how to care for young children/babies, CPR, and emergency safety. I am fully vaccinated, a non-smoker, and my schedule is flexible. \n\nMy rates are open to negotiation depending on your needs and the ages of your children:)",

For my parents that was since I was about 9 years old. They always worked late and I was there to help out. I then started to get paid around the age of 12 for babysitting regularly in my neighborhood for two families. I babysat them for 4 years until I went to high school and their oldest girl was now the babysitter. I still talk to both families today and love their kids endlessly! I was a camp counselor in high school during the summers for inner city children in Baltimore. I was assigned 4 kids every summer for 4 summers. I nannied in college on the weekdays as well and am entirely comfortable with all ages and I absolutely adore children, girls and boys. I find I get along with many different kinds of children and know how to be a wonderful caretaker.",

I hold a BA in Childhood Education and Political Science, also from Columbia. \n\nI am well-versed in the developmental needs of babies and toddlers, and will always make my time with your little ones stimulatory as well as fun. I believe in keeping screen time to a minimum and encouraging active learning through play. I am infant/child CPR and First Aid certified, and have taken courses in child development and safety. And, I am fully vaccinated and boosted against COVID-19 (and the flu!).\n\nI'll be off of school for most of January, so I'm looking for any temp babysitting/nanny opportunities/would love to develop ongoing relationships with a few new fams for as-needed babysitting! \n\nWarmly,\nEmma",

As a mom of a young child, I've developed a deep love for all children and a strong understanding and empathy for parents, especially moms.\n\nI've cared for my own child and spent a year babysitting for a friend, and I know how much love, patience, and energy it takes to care for little ones.\n\nFor my background, I have a Master's degree in Design, so I love making everyday moments more fun and creative. I'm a native Mandarin speaker and fluent in English, and I've also worked as a Mandarin tutor if you'd like your child to be exposed to the Mandarin language.\n\nEvery family deserves a helping hand to lighten the load and give you back some time for yourself! I'm happy to help with light housework like meal prepping and grocery shopping. I'm patient, caring, and reliable, and I'd love to be a helping hand for your family!",
