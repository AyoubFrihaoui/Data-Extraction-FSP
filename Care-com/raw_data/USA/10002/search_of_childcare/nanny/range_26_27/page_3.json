I am comfortable caring for children from infancy through teenage years and would be happy to assist in other tasks as requested. I maintained a 4. 0 GPA all four years of college through my organization skills, hard work, and discipline. I am great at playing pretend, supervising and assisting arts and crafts, and as a former picky eater, I am a great cook and baker for even the most selective kids. I worked as a party princess for several years and kids are usually drawn to me. No vehicle, but I do have a driver's license and experience driving kids in NYC.

I'm confident in my ability to structure and facilitate fun, supportive and age appropriate care for children of all ages.\nI love children, and enjoy helping them at each stage of their young lives. (I've maintained close ties to many of my \"past\" families, and it's a privilege to watch these kids learn and grow!)
