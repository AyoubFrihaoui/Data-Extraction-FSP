My journey began with rewarding babysitting roles, where I discovered my knack for fostering a nurturing environment. I have been babysitting since I was in elementary school for my cousins. Now that I am an 18-year-old college student, I have learned all the do's-and-dont's of going about how to interact with kids. My patient and calm demeanor, coupled with my creative and imaginative nature, allows me to connect with children on a deeper level, creating a joyful and stimulating atmosphere.\n\nI firmly believe in open and transparent communication with parents. I am committed to providing daily written reports and actively following their preferred method of communication to ensure a collaborative partnership.\n\nMy approach to childcare extends beyond mere supervision. I am very comfortable enforcing household rules while maintaining a positive and respectful environment.",

Over the past four years, I've also had the opportunity to work at a preschool in Westport, CT (I am originally from Fairfield, CT), which has given me extensive experience in early childhood development. I've learned how to engage kids in educational activities, help with homework, and manage different needs in a structured, nurturing environment. I've also completed CPR training and always seek ways to expand my skills. As a current student living at Fordham University, I am close to the city! I'm looking for a steady family in NYC who needs reliable, caring support weeknights, on weekends, or occasional date nights. I'd love to become a trusted part of your family!",

I was an au pair for 1 year in Fort Thomas, KY in 2021. When I was an aupair, I was taking care of 3 months girl. She was 16 months when my program ended. After my aupair program I'm keep working as a nanny. I was taking care of 1-year-old in Ohio. When I started, he was 3 months. I worked with them for 10 months then they moved another state. Then I worked with two different babies during their short-term needs for five months. Now. I'm taking care of the baby. He is almost 1 and a half years old. Also, I have my own car. I have lots of great references if you would like to talk to them. I have also experience for 2 years from my country, totally, 5 years of experiences. I love being and spending time with the children! If you would like to talk to me, I would like to talk about myself and my experiences more! I'm looking forward to hear you! Thank you!",
