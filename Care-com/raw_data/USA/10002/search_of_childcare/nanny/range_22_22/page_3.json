I come from a large family where I have 10 nieces and nephews I watch on a regular basis from 2 years old to 15 years old! Being their aunt has given me the experience to watch and care for any age. \n\nI love kids and appreciate their influential minds. I feel it is important to leave lasting positive impacts on the youth and treat them with the kindness and respect they deserve. I spent 2 years with my last nanny family where they started off as a 3-year-old and 2-month-old! I am confident and secure taking care of small children and have gone through CPR training. \n\nI know how important it is to have someone caring for your kids and trusting a stranger! I strive to put every parent at ease when they leave the house and will take care of your kids as if they're mine.",

I spent summer 2020 nannying for three young boys, ages ranging from nine to 12. I spent the next summer nannying a 1. 5-year-old girl, and had an amazing time with both age groups. Through these experiences, I cemented my love for childcare. While 2020 was my first time being a full-time nanny, I spent my first two years of high school watching my neighbors child, from the time she was one to the time she was three. I believe I have a knack for generating creative opportunities for fun, as well as understanding a child's emotional needs. I am adaptable, and happy to help with any household chores and/or activities a child is already doing. I have two years experience as a volunteer tutor for elementary school children, so am comfortable helping with homework and schooling. I'm more than happy to provide reference contacts!",

When she watched our son it was quite hot outside, and she was very conscientious of making sure he stayed cool, taking him outside to play at the water table and always changing him into dry clothes afterwards.

My approach to childcare includes a variety of games and activities, both educational and recreational, to cater to different age groups.
