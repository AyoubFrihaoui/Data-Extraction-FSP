My name is Mira, I recently moved to New York city from DC to explore the city and take some time off before I go to law school in the fall.\n\nI am active and energetic, and I love children. I enjoy skiing, running, swimming, cooking, and arts and crafts! I will bring this sort of energy into my time with your children, but I also understand that safety is the top priority. \n\nI am experienced with caring for multiple children at a time at a variety of different ages. I also have many years of experience tutoring elementary and middle school children, so I am able to help with schooling and homework. I am certified in babysitting, First Aid, and CPR, and I speak some Spanish. \n\nI would love to hear from you and can provide references upon request! \n\nThanks, \nMira",
