This experience made me want to return to this line of work because it was so rewarding to have fun, be creative, and provide a safe space for kids to be themselves. I am friendly and approachable and my own childhood of creative and imaginative play allows me to really connect with kids. I believe in open communication with parents and am happy to follow their preferred methods to discuss their child's day or any concerns. Regarding household rules, I follow the parents' lead to ensure consistency for the kids. I'm happy to play and have fun or help with schoolwork- whatever is best! I'm comfortable caring for up to three children, ranging from infants to preteens. Additionally, I'm certified in First Aid and CPR. I'm happy to assist with cooking, light housekeeping, and other various errands. Reach out, and let's see if I would be a good fit to care for your kids!",

I believe the caretaker-child relationship is extremely unique and valuable, and aim to foster a meaningful connection with the children and families I care for. I pride myself on leading with both empathy and compassion. I am trained in conflict resolution and have strong mentoring skills. On top of my childcare experience, I have eight years of experience teaching dance. I'm super creative and have an extensive background in the arts (dance, studio art, sculpture work, etc...)
