My experience spans caring for infants, toddlers, and school-aged children. I'm comfortable caring for up to three children at a time and am well-versed in enforcing household rules. I believe open and consistent communication with parents is essential, so I provide regular updates on their child's day and am always available to address any concerns. From playing educational games to teaching swimming, I strive to make learning fun and engaging. Let's connect and explore how I can support your family's childcare needs.",

I am very close to the families I have worked with! I know the importance of great care and I will provide that. I can perform all the duties associated with caring for children, from feeding and bathing to dressing and readying for bed.\nI have managed sleep training, refusal of the bottle, potty training, recognizing and helping family address difficult or life-changing behavior (such as Autism, asthma, and severe discipline issues). I know to work well with a family, one has to be dedicated and a team player - I am both. I have many years experience caring for children of all ages, from newborn/infants to teenagers. I understand days and times need to be flexible, may be needed late nights or weekends. I am comfortable with this. I have organized all kinds of trips from going to the library, movies, Barnes and Noble book stores, Museums, Zoo and park trips, and picnics! I know how to take direction very well and follow household rules, adhering to parents' guidelines. Can provide some advice and/or tips, but first and foremost respect your wishes.\nMy appearance is neat and clean. I am not a talker on cell phones... only use them when necessary. Will text or call you with updates during the day. I do not smoke or use drugs. Attention to safety and health are my primary concerns. I am dedicated, loving and responsible, am a U.S. citizen - born and raised in the U.S. Graduated high school and have an Associates Degree in Business Administration. I am extremely responsible and reliable/dependable, and punctual. I possess calm with a positive can-do attitude. Your child will have my devotion and I will care for her/him with love, patience, kindness, understanding and warmth. Comfortable with pets too. Certification pending for infant/child CPR and first aid for choking.\nI love caring for children and take it very seriously. I live in Manhattan and can get to you quickly. Should we work together, my schedule will be flexible to meet your needs and I communicate well and effectively. I can also perform light household duties. I would also be available for additional hours in the evening and on weekend hours. I have excellent references, and I look forward to meeting you very soon. Have a great day.",
