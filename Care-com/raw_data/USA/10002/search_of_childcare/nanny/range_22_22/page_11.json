In addition to my 4 years of (paid) experience, I grew up in a house with 8 children so I have been babysitting since I was a baby! I am very patient and reliable especially when it comes to children. I have experience with special needs children as my youngest sibling is also special needs. I can help with travel and light housekeeping as well as helping your child with school work and tutoring. I am currently a student working a nanny job M/T/TH/F so I am mostly available as a weekend sitter but I am also available on Wednesdays as well. I am most comfortable working with 1-3 children but I have also worked with up to 4 children at a time.

Currently, I am the Communications Manager at a nonprofit in the city, where I've been working for the last 5 years. \n\nAs the eldest of four, I started babysitting at 12 and have since worked with diverse families. I've handled households with five kids (including twins) and provided compassionate care for a family with a child with special needs - even after their move to the West Coast, they still fly me out to care for their kids during travels. I've also been a regular nanny for an international banker's family in Manhattan.\n\nBeyond babysitting, I've life-guarded, coached, and was a camp counselor for six summers. These roles allowed me to blend the elements of fun and freedom with a keen sense of safety and discipline when necessary. My commitment to creating a nurturing and engaging environment, along with my diverse experiences, makes me confident in providing exceptional care!",

My calm, friendly demeanor puts children at ease, while my formal training in early childhood development ensures that I'm equipped to provide a safe, nurturing environment. I keep parents informed about their child's day through daily reports or verbal communication at pickup, whichever they prefer. I follow the parents' lead when it comes to enforcing household rules. I love playing outdoor sports, board games, and educational games with children. I'm comfortable caring for two children, and I have experience with a wide range of age groups, from infants to preteens. I'm willing to assist with cooking, meal preparation, and light housekeeping. In addition to CPR training, I've also taken coursework in early childhood development. I hope to have the opportunity to care for your child and support your family!",

I just moved back to NYC from Madrid where I spent the year teaching English, and got the chance to work at an elementary school. I was also able to tutor several students one-on-one in English. Prior to this past year, I have been regularly babysitting both in and out of NYC for several years. I also interned at the summer camp for Child Mind Instituate in 2022, where I was able to work with children with behavioral disorders and learn how to teach them prosocial behaviors. I love working with kids, so please reach out to me if you need a babysitter! I can also help with cooking and cleaning!",
