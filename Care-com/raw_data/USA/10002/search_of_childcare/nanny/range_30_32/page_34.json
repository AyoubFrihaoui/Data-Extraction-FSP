It truly has been the most beautiful transition! I have 10+ years of experience working with children, ranging from infancy to childhood. My love for working with children began since I was 7 years old; truly believing that I was created to love and educate the lives of our future generation. \n\nI am a public school special education teacher of 7 years. I am currently looking to provide a family with structure, fun, and lessening the load of the typical household! \n\nI would be more than happy to tell you more about myself.

                  "originalText": "Jarelle was the after school caregiver for my three boys for almost four years. She became like family to us. Jarelle picked up my boys from school and helped them get to/from after school activities, complete homework assignments, get dinner started and keep our apartment tidy. She is incredibly kind and supportive as well as flexible - she was always happy to stay a little late when work was keeping me at the office later than planned. A few times, she helped me out by watching our family dog for us while we were out of town.\r\n\r\nJarelle will help support your parenting preferences at home so long as you communicate them (no sweets before dinner, homework before playtime, etc etc). She is wonderful and you will not regret hiring Jarelle! I am a very happy referral for her. Should you like to speak further, Jarelle can pass along my contact information.",
