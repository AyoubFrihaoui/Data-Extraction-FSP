I find a lot of meaning and gratification in caring for my loved ones, and that extends into child care because children need us to protect and be a friend to them, at all ages! \n\nI have a flexible schedule and am happy to accommodate your specific needs once we meet and learn more about each other.\n\nI started babysitting kids when I was 13 and did it for years on and off until I went to college. \n\nSome of my most relevant skills include cooking, patience, and communication.

I can also do general housekeeping or run any errands, or help the kids with their homework. I'm happy to make things a little easier for you.\n\nDue to my work as an educator, I have passed extensive background screening. I have taken courses on first aid, CPR for children and infants, and administering medications and epi pens. Fortunately, this has never been needed while babysitting",

Most of my clients in NYC nowadays are about 6 months to 7 years old, and I sit regularly. \n\nPrevious experience includes nannying 2 boys (9 and 12), and assistant-teaching English at two middle schools in Versailles, France. I also worked for 9 summers as a camp counselor, eventually working my way up to Assistant Camp Director at a Girl Scout camp in Tennessee.
