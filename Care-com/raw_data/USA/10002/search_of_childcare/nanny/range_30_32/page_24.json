My journey in child care began over a decade ago when as a teenager I started babysitting for various families in my neighborhood. Since then I have worked with dozens of families and children of all ages. In 2020, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Psychology, adding an academic foundation to my practical experience. My educational background has not only expanded my understanding of child development but also instilled in me a deep appreciation for the importance of mental and emotional well-being in a child's formative years. Currently, I work in clinical trial operations at a well known cancer hospital. \nI am committed to creating a nurturing environment where your child can thrive. Whether it's assisting with homework, engaging in creative activities, or simply providing a caring presence.

I'm comfortable caring for up to two children and have experience with all age groups. I can also help with cooking, light housekeeping, travel, and swimming supervision. I'm a certified teacher and have taken coursework in early childhood development, as well as First Aid and CPR training.\n\nIf you're looking for a reliable, friendly, and experienced childcare provider, I'd love to meet you and your family.",

My patience and calm demeanor help create a nurturing environment where children feel safe and loved. I believe in open communication with parents and follow their preferred methods to discuss their child's day or any concerns.\n\nEnforcing household rules comes naturally to me, as I understand the importance of structure and consistency. From outdoor sports to educational games, I enjoy a variety of activities that promote physical, social, and intellectual development. With a graduate degree and certifications in First Aid and CPR, I am well-equipped to care for up to four children of all ages.\n\nI am fluent in English and French and am happy to assist with cooking, meal preparation, light housekeeping, and swimming supervision. I am excited about the opportunity to support families and provide reliable childcare.",
