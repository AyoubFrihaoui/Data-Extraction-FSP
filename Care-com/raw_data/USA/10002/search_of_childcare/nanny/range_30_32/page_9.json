Caretaking is a part of who I am and babysitting over all these years is one of the reasons I switched career paths from media to social work (as a therapist). I have a Masters degree in Social work, have around 2+ years working in a clinical settings, and thrive in a range of environments. I find caring for and working with children to be fulfilling and complimentary to my profession. Credentials aside it is most important to me that I bring compassion, creativity, kindness and collaboration to everything I do.

Growing up in a large, loving African family with four younger sisters, I naturally became the go-to helper for caring for my siblings and other young family members. Babysitting has been a part of my life since I was 16, and over the years, I've looked after children of all ages during afterschool hours, weekends, and holidays.\n\nWith a patient, caring, and communicative approach, I love supporting kids with their homework and encouraging their curiosity through cultural and artistic activities. I also offer French lessons for those interested in language learning. I believe in creating a safe, creative, and engaging environment where children feel heard and valued. \n\nIf you're looking for a warm and dependable sitter with a passion for nurturing young minds, I'd be delighted to connect!",
