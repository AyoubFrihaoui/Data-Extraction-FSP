I've also tutored in Science, Math (up to Algebra), and Spanish (grammar, reading, and writing).\n\nCertified in Basic Life Support (CPR/First Aid) by the American Heart Association (valid through 12/2025).\n\nComfortable with pets and happy to assist with their care for an additional fee.\nMy ultimate goal is to support families by providing reliable childcare tailored to your parenting style and values",

I started nannying in 2015 until I graduated in 2018 with a Bachelor of Science in Public Administration. In 2019 I decided to put my degree to use and started working at a preschool for children with autism. I was a Teacher's Aide and then transitioned to Executive Assistant. Both positions were part-time, and I needed a full-time job. I left the preschool and worked as an Assistant Director at a tutoring center. At the tutoring center, I worked with children K-12 and managed part-time teachers. I left my job at the tutoring center and started nannying again for a year. I am now pursuing a master's degree in early childhood education birth-2nd grade.",
