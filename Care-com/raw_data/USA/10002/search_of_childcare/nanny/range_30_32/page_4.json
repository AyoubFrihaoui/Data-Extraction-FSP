In addition to my experience in the classroom, I have babysat for many families with children of all ages (newborns to teenagers) and worked for four summers at sleep away camp. I have also tutored children, worked in after school programs and worked at day camp for three summers. I greatly enjoy working with and caring for children. I am available to babysit on Fridays and the weekend. I have no problem with taking children out, preparing meals, providing homework assistance, facilitating games and activities, and taking care of bath time and bedtime. I am more than happy to help your family in any way I can:)",
