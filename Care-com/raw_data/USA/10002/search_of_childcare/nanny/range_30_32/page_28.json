As a recent college graduate, I am excited to pursue my passion for caring for others by returning to school to study nursing, with plans to specialize in pediatric care in the NICU. My experience as a nanny has allowed me to develop strong skills in creating nurturing and safe environments where children can thrive, learn, and grow. I have a true passion for engaging children in creative activities, supporting outdoor play, and encouraging them to reach their developmental milestones. I believe in providing a balanced, loving environment where children can explore their curiosity and feel safe and supported. I would love the opportunity to contribute to your family's well-being, offering you peace of mind while caring for your little ones.",

I started full-time job as Nanny for a 6-month-old boy in 2016 then another 2nd baby in the year of 2017. Being a nanny doesn't limit my capacity to do chores, doing dishes, laundry and tidying esp the bedroom and playroom of the kids. Sept of 2018, I have to leave the family, as I'm preparing myself to be a mom. After few months of giving birth I get back to work as part time nanny/ housekeeper for 2 families. I find my work very rewarding and thus, I am committed to provide a happy, positive and nurturing environment for the family in my care. Also, I took courses on Caregiver lessons and was teaching Reading and Writing to kindergarten students on summer and school breaks. I find my work very rewarding and thus, I am committed to provide a happy, positive and nurturing environment for the children in my care. Working with kids, gives me the feeling of still being close to my own kid.",

I spent the past five years teaching special education in Williamson County, TN, and am now gearing up to obtain a graduate degree in educational leadership at at Columbia University in the Fall.\nI am in Nashville through the end of August, then will be based in NYC. I have experience in both full-time nannying and part-time babysitting positions, working with children at infancy, through high school. I have experience working with children both typically developing and with minor to significant disabilities, in a variety of settings. Additionally, I have a successful private tutoring business for students with disabilities. I absolutely love being around children and fostering relationships with families in the process.
