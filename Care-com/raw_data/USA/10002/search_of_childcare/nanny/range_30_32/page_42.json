My passion for fostering their growth and development led me to this fulfilling career. I'm patient, creative, and easily approachable, always maintaining open communication with parents about their children's progress. I have no qualms enforcing household rules while playing a variety of games with the kids, like sports, board games, and educational games.\n\nI have an Associates degree in Early Childhood Education, completed early childhood development coursework and hold certifications in First Aid and CPR. I spent two years working as an assistant, lead and afterschool teacher with children ages 10 months to 5 years old. Besides childcare, I can help with meal preparation, light housekeeping, travel, and swimming supervision. I'm eager to meet your family and am confident that I'll be a great fit for your childcare needs.",
