I have cared for newborns and their cheeky toddler-tween siblings and cared for children with special needs one on one. I'm always excited to share my interests in art and music with the children I'm taking care of and learning about what they are interested in and what they are curious about.\n I am open to the occasional babysitting, errand running, child commuting, weekly help, and can be flexible with varied weeks. \n Please feel free to message me with any questions- would love to chat!",

After spending over 4 years working as an editor and writer in the field of corporate communications, I've transitioned to supporting kids and families again as a caregiver. I'm enrolled in a graduate degree program at Sarah Lawrence College where I am working towards my Master's in Fine Arts (MFA) in Creative Writing. I'm passionate about education and creativity, and I'm eager to support kids and families by combining my love for fostering healthy childhood development with my experience as a teacher, tutor, and writer. My goal is to be a creative writing educator, specifically working with young children and adolescents to help them discover the joy of writing and reading poetry.

Working with children is the most rewarding job I can imagine and I consider it a privilege to be able to do so. I am a lead teacher at a well respected preschool in Manhattan, graduating soon with a master's degree in Early Childhood Education and have a bachelors degree in psychology. I understand how impactful play is to the development of children, and am engaged, present and always looking for opportunities to play with intention. I'm not afraid to get on the floor and be silly, play hide and seek for hours and I have the recipe for homemade play dough memorized. I have professionally cared for newborns as young as 2 weeks, senior citizens with special need and all ages in between.",
