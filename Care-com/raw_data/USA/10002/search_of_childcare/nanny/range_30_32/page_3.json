While I am looking to fill up some of my free time (I like to keep busy!) I am also looking forward to meeting a new family and helping out. I absolutely love all animals and am happy to help with cleaning and household chores. I'm also energetic and creative; I adore children who love to play and are looking for fun activities. \n\nI started working with kids in middle school and helped with my neighbor's two boys. In high school I continued to babysit for numerous families on the weekends and spent my summers volunteering at a local elementary school. In the summer of 2020, I babysat for a family down the street from me and tutored them during online school. After that, I started helping a family in my college town (I found them on care. com). I had a great experience with the family and am excited to meet another through care!",

I am a professional nanny with over 17years of experience working with multiple children, ranging from infants to adolescents, both at nurseries and private homes, and children along the Autism spectrum as well. I like to see how children grow up and understand the world, I teach them to share and to be kind. With the consent of families I can go to  museums , shows, the Zoo, and the Garden. Some of the families I have worked with still invite me to their parties, and their children still remember and embrace me. That is the best feeling, the part that really touches my heart.

I have an overall end goal to become a child psychologist to help kids express their emotions and help them with processing big events. I am currently working odd jobs while I work on getting licensed and thinking of applying to doctoral programs. However I would love to have a more stable job and would love for it to be working with you and you're cuties! I love kids, but 3-4-year-olds have always had a special place in my heart. I used to babysit my little cousins and neighbors but they have all since grown from my need. I am so looking forward to seeing new littles grow and develop. Thank you so much! I look forward to hearing from you!",
