I will be open for opportunities on Tuesdays and Thursdays again starting May 2025, and am available for babysitting!\n\nPreviously, I cared for a 2-year-old weekday mornings, and a 3 and 5-year-old during afternoons in Hawaii. Before that, I cared for a 9mo 40hrs/week in New York, and in 2021 I spent a year as an au pair for three children ages 3, 5 and 8 in France. For three summers I assisted with an art and science children's day camp in New York.\n\nMy responsibilities have included picking kids up from school, planning activities, preparing dinner, bath time, bedtime, visiting the park or library, reading, baking, crafts, and more. \n\nI am responsible, kind, playful, and honest. I truly enjoy my time with kids, especially the joy of play and crafts!",

As the oldest to two younger siblings, my caregiving experience started early. Growing up, we had limited access to TV and things like video games and leaned towards activities such as reading and crafting. During high school I ran track and cross country I also earned my lifeguarding and CPR certification and spent my summers lifeguarding and teaching swimming lessons at our public pool and babysitting. I earned a degree in Economics from Fordham University where I tutored peers in Micro and Macro Economics. Since graduating, I've worked in SaaS generating revenue for startups. I'm taking a career break and am looking to spend more time with children.\nSummary:> Professional working in SaaS for over 8 years > Lifeguard and CPR certified > Absolutely comfortable taking care of pets, Montessori educated > Love making healthy meals > Help with homework, cleaning & practice of instruments",

With three years of experience and a college degree under my belt, I am confident in my ability to provide a safe, nurturing, and stimulating environment for your child.\n\nMy approach to childcare is centered around patience, creativity, and empathy. I believe in fostering a positive and respectful relationship with both children and parents. I keep parents updated about their child's day and promptly address any concerns that may arise. \n\nI am comfortable enforcing household rules while maintaining a warm and nurturing environment. I love playing a variety of games with children, from outdoor sports to board games and educational activities. I am also happy to assist with light housekeeping and supervise swimming activities.\n\nAs a certified CPR provider, I am trained to handle emergencies and ensure the safety of the children in my care.",
