I have always loved kids, and have multiple summers worth of nannying experience with strong references. I am super outdoorsy, so I get along really well with children who like to play outside and go for bikes/walks/hikes. However I can always get down with a good game night or some arts and crafts too. I generally follow a gentle parenting style, however will make sure to learn and understand your parenting style for continuity's sake. Organizing is one of my strong suits, so I am willing to help with anything around the house as well. \nDuring my free time you could find me skiing at Killington or sewing a new outfit. Looking forward to starting!",

I miss spending time with those girls (who I consider as my little sisters!) and would love the opportunity to work as a babysitter here in NYC. I have a undergraduate and graduate degree in international relations from the University of London, and work remotely as a consultant for an international economic development firm in Arlington. My husband and I moved to NYC from DC last year with our corgi puppy, Donna. I love spending time outdoors and am always ready to play and have all sorts of fun with children.
