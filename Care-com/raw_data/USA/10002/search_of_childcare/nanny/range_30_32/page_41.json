I am CPR and First Aid certified and have also completed a course in Child Sexual Abuse Awareness and Response. I am looking for a Part-Time babysitting position and am available weekdays and nights as well as weekends. I love being creative and imaginative. I prefer to spend time away from screens with kiddos. I love music, playing games, dancing, singing, arts and crafts, telling stories, reading, going to parks and so much more! I also have plenty of experience taking children to various doctor appointments (the not-so-fun activities). I love following a schedule while also leaving room for kids to be kids!
