However, she always demonstrates grace in this area and gets the job done. She helps with laundry, grocery shopping, errands, child pickups, and keeping the childrenâ€™s areas tidy and clean. \n\nWe are confident that choosing Katie for this position will not disappoint.

But my enthusiasm and passion for kids isn't limited to my professional life. I've been hired by multiple families from Care. com, caring for children ranging from 15 months to 12 years old. I've traveled with families to their part time weekend residences. They spoke highly of my ability to \"jump right in\" and even passed along my contact info to their friends! In college, I taught in a preschool classroom with children between the ages of 4-5. I've also worked as a personal care attendant for a young child with autism. I also volunteered as a mentor for a program that matches college students with children from low-income situations. Even more so than these endeavors, I think that my infectious energy, creativity and sense of humor are what set me apart.",

After that I came to the US to be an AuPair in NJ for 2 years (2017 to 2019) where I took care of 3 kids (newborn, 2 and 4-year-old). After that, I went to Cairo-Egypt (2021) to do a volunteer work and, when I finished, they gave me a full time job so I lived there for 6 months working as a teacher at an International School in Cairo. After coming back to the US, I worked for a few families as a babysitter and recently worked for a Family in Greenwich Village for 1 year and 5 months but unfortunately had to leave because the girls went to school full time. I consider myself kind, patient and energetic. I love being outside and explore different activities. I believe that gentle conversations and being a good example is the best way to teach kids and have their respect.\n\nI have great references!\n\nI'm open to any questions you might have!\nLooking forward to hearing from you :)",
