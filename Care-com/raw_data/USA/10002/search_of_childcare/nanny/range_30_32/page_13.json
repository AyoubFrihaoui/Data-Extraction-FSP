I have lived in Brooklyn for my entire life, and know different neighborhoods throughout NYC very well. I am the oldest of 4 siblings, one of whom is 2 years old. Being the oldest definitely plays a role in my experience and passion for taking care of children. I enjoy babysitting and being around children, having worked with families of all ages for over 8 years since I was 14 years old. I have babysat for newborns, toddlers, and older children, even for families of 2-3 children and pets. I also handle household tasks such as cooking, pick ups, and errands. I enjoy helping, teaching, and having fun with children. A few things about me are that I am fluent in Polish, I love traveling and being out in nature, I have a dog named Mia, and I love to bake.",

I have over 10 years of experience as I have babysat for all ages throughout college, a masters program, and thereafter. Childcare comes naturally to me. I have a squeaky clean driving record, so pickups and drop offs are welcome. As a child care provider, I am most proud when children feel comfortable enough with me to ask meaningful questions, or allow me to sing or read them to sleep, age permitting. I love playing peek-a-boo with babies and having dance parties with toddlers! At my last job, I loved that I was able to cook, bake, help active kids in keeping healthy, take trips to the park, and foster imaginative and intelligent play! I also adore pets and can help with light house work, gladly.\nI am also offering private art lessons. Please message me for more details.",

In high school, I took a class called Childhood Occupations where I worked in preschool and elementary classrooms. As a teen and college student, I taught gymnastics and cheerleading and have worked in two daycare centers. For the last decade I have been working in marketing however, I am currently looking for a new role and hoping to make some extra money while in between jobs. I've been very involved with many newborns and am typically the adult entertaining everyone's kids or hanging with an adorable baby. Would love to meet your family and see if we're a fit!",

The only disappointment is that she is not based in CA, which is where we are currently living...we are looking forward to using her again when we are in NY next! Rachel is a great communicator, extremely responsible, and understands relational dynamics with children, she is so easy and enjoyable to be around.
