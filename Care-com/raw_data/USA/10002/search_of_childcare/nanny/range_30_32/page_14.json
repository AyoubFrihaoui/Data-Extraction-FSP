A in psychology and theater, with a focus on theatrical learning and play. \n\nOne month after graduating, I began nannying (who I met through care. com), a mom in Fort Greene. During my time working I took care of her 3-year-old son, cooked and prepared meals for the family, and did various household chores and organizational tasks. Furthermore, I traveled with her and her son to their family vacation house in Maine on two different occasions, where I obtained the same responsibilities.

I have loved every family I have worked for and provide a fun filled atmosphere that allows children to express themselves. I am a martial artist (kickboxing and jiu jitsu) and have played sports my whole life. I was on the Brooklyn college Women's volleyball team. I love to keep kids active through sport. I have a tutoring background as I worked prior in P. S. 184m and was an after school instructor in 2018. I also have lifeguard experience as I have lifeguarded for two summers.

I'm bilingual, fluent in English and Mandarin Chinese. In college, where I attended Pratt Institute, I baby sat many of my professor's kids, their ages ranged from newborn to 9 years old. M main charges in college were a 5-year-old boy and a 4-year-old girl. I picked them up from school, took them to the playground, helped with homework and dinner prep. After graduating, I moved to Paris, France to teach English to French middle schoolers. I also worked as an au-pair for two French children, one boy 10 years old and a girl 12 years old, picking them up from school, making dinner for them every night, and helping with homework. I also stayed overnight with them occasionally when needed. \r\n\r\nI'm great with pets as well, happy to help making healthy dinners as needed. I'm currently working full-time as a writer, but looking for part time work.",
