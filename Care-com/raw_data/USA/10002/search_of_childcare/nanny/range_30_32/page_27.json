I started as a mother's helper, watching a 7-year-old and his 3-year-old brother, while their mother worked from home. Over the years I graduated to a much more independent approach with children, and have taken care of over 15 children from different families. I have experience watching babies overnight as well as during the day, and know how to change a diaper, how to feed an infant, etc. I also have experience with older kids, and know how to keep them entertained without just having them watch tv or play video games. I've worked with children that have special needs and I am very respectful and accommodating to whatever routines a family may have. I absolutely love working with children, and love getting to know them individually so I can take great care of them!",

I recently have had experience with infants and 6-18-month-olds, feeding, changing diapers, taking on walks and to other classes, putting down for naps, playing with sensory toys, etc. I can provide references from past families! I have also had experience babysitting kids ages 4-11 and work closely with this age group at my job as well. I can help with picking up kids, taking to after school activities, help with errands and laundry, and engage and play with kids. I'm currently looking to work after school hours, as well as do occasional babysitting whether it be full days or date nights! Please reach out if I could be of any help!",
