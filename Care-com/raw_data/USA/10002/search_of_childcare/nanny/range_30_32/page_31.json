After my mother fell ill, I realized that being close to family and doing more hands on work was calling me. It's been an honor to help provide child care for family and friends. I studied human development in college and have always been passionate about children but until now, it was behind the scenes. Helping to rear a child is truly one of the most important jobs any one can do. There is no magic wand but dedication to keeping them safe, engaged, and teaching kindness/respect are my priorities. I have a way of connecting with kids because I understand their development process. Sadly there aren't as many male caregivers out there and think it's important for children to have more male role models when possible.",
