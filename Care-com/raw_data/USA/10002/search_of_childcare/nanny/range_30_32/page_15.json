I have 8 years of experience babysitting, ranging from a full-time nanny to a date night sitter! I'm a very playful and energetic sitter, and I genuinely love spending time with kids. I'm also happy to help with housework, homework, or anything you need. Many families I've worked with have commented on the joy and ease I bring to their homes. It makes me so happy to spread that!",

I have been babysitting for nine years and have experience with children ages 3 months to 15 years old (I primarily work with children ages six and below). I have also worked as a camp counselor and ski instructor for children. My education and experience have given me great instincts and developmentally advantageous child care skills. \n\nI love animals and am comfortable with pets. I am CPR and First Aid certified. I am happy to provide references. My rate is $30 an hour for one child and increases $5/hour per child.

My personal favorite was the one year I spent as nanny for infant twin boys, which was challenging and delightful!\nI am reliable, punctual, and responsible, but also a kid at heart -- energetic, playful, and creative. When I babysit, I like to keep the kids active and engaged, i. e. reading books, playing games, spending time outdoors, doing arts and crafts, and making music! They won't be on devices all day. \nI love to cook, and I'm happy to help out with light tidying and cleaning. \nI am a professional piano teacher, so some of my afternoons and evenings are usually spent teaching lessons, however, I am flexible with scheduling! \nI am available for school drop offs and pickups, date nights, and play dates!",

I have taught both 1st and 3rd grade, along with having numerous field/student teaching experiences ranging with children from ages 2-10 years old. Although I am no longer in the education field and have transitioned into sales for healthcare- I still have such a strong love for children due to my first profession and years of study.

I have experience working with a range of ages, from 17 months - 13 years, and have been working with multiple families in Brooklyn since moving to New York last year. I am enthusiastic, energetic, organized, and adore working with kids! I also have experience in theatre and the arts, and love doing hands-on projects. \n\nI'm also available to help out with schoolwork. I spent three years helping third-grade students learn how to read with \"Start Making A Reader Today\" and volunteered as a lunch buddy to elementary school kids while I was in college. My academic writing has been published by the Yale Review of International Studies and the Brookings Institution, and I've worked on Capitol Hill, as a fact-checker, and as a podcast producer.",
