With a decade of experience in childcare, I have honed my skills in fostering a safe and nurturing environment for children of all ages. My approach to childcare is centered around patience, creativity, and open communication with parents. I believe in following the parents' lead when it comes to enforcing household rules and prefer to communicate regularly about their child's day. My diverse skill set includes cooking, light housekeeping, and swimming supervision, and I am certified in both First Aid and CPR. I am fluent in both English and Spanish. I enjoy engaging children in outdoor activities, board games, and educational games that stimulate their learning. I am seeking a position where I can use my skills and experience to support families and provide reliable childcare for children between the ages of 0 and 10 (open to discussing if outside of age range).",

But my most recent experiences are with infants and toddlers. \n\nA bit of my background...\n\nI graduated from Tufts University in 2020 with majors in Environmental Studies and Environmental Relations (a self designed major focused on developing environmental stewardship in young people). Since graduating, I've worked as a babysitter and pet sitter, a climate justice organizer, a political canvasser, and a union organizer. \n\nI currently work for the NYC Department of Education as a paraprofessional for children with special needs. My goal is to become a teacher! \n\nAs a caregiver, I like to emphasize outdoor time, music, and social-emotional learning. But my top priority is to meet each child and family where they are in order to support healthy development.",

They were extremely conscientious and communicative, and we always felt comfortable knowing Caro could handle any challenge that came up and keep us fully informed if needed.
