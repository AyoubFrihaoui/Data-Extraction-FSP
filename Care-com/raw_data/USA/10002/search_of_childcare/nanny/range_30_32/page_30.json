I've spent more than a decade embracing the wonderful chaos and pure joy that comes with caring for children from their first breath to their twelfth birthday. There's nothing quite like the thrill I get from their infectious laughter and innocent curiosity - it's the highlight of my day, every day. These little humans, with their big hearts and bigger dreams, teach me invaluable lessons about kindness, resilience, patience, courage, and love. They are the leaders of tomorrow, and I consider it an honor to play a small part in shaping their journey.\n\nMy approach to childcare is a blend of letting the kids take the reins and guiding them through new experiences, from playtime and baking to museum visits, reading, dancing, and the limitless world of make-believe. I'm eager to bring my love for childcare into a new home, and I look forward to meeting an amazing family soon!\n\nAll the best,\n\nYejide.",

While I don't have formal paid babysitting experience, I've gained valuable personal experience caring for my cousins and niece when they were younger. I understand the importance of trust, communication, and creating a safe, engaging environment for kids.\n\nWhen caring for your child, I'll ensure you are always informed through calls or texts, so you feel confident and connected. I can also help with homework, play games, and prioritize their needs.\n\nWith my extroverted and approachable personality, I create a warm, comfortable environment and always prioritize the child's well-being.\n\nI look forward to getting to know your family and being a part of your child's day!",

As a caregiver, safety is always paramount, so I have received my pediatric CPR and first aid certification, and am fully vaccinated. I also spent several years in Hong Kong as a child and am very comfortable in third culture households.

I always look forward to putting smiles on a child's face and working various little personalities and temperaments. I perform tasks such as changing diapers, feeding (whether bottle or baby food), bathing, one on one interaction, and taking them outside for walks/activities. For infants/toddlers, I can assist with sleep and feeding schedules along with being a great reference for advice! For preschool/school aged children, I assist with homework help, social interactions, activity planning, etc. I am familiar with various parenting and discipline styles in addition to various methods of introductions to solid foods for infants and toddlers.",
