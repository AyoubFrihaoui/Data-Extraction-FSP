I have spent the last 6 years teaching creative movement/yoga to pre-k- 3rd grade. Prior to that I was a caretaker for several different families for about 7 years. I have worked with a large range of children who all have strong individual differences whether it be in age, special needs, behavior, development, experience, or interests, which has helped me to become more adaptive and understanding of children's needs. The duties I have undertaken as a caregiver include: helping with homework, changing diapers, cooking dinner, bedtime, taking them to after-school activities, and of course hanging out and having fun! I'm extremely personable and have an easygoing disposition but understand the importance of structure in a child's development. I have honestly enjoyed every family I have worked with and value what I have learned from each child.",

My name is Symone, I'm a 25-year-old student working toward a dual gradate degree in law and business. I've lived in New York City for several years I wanted to continue to foster my love of connecting with children by continuing to babysit. I have 8+ years of babysitting experience taking care of children ranging from 15 years old to infants. In addition to English, I speak French and I am also CPR and First Aid certified. As an older sister and the eldest of several younger cousins I am well versed in keeping children entertained. From playing board games or playing in the park I am ready to participate in fun activities to keep your child happy! \n\nAdditionally, I can perform an array of additional responsibilities: cleaning the house, cooking dinner, run errands, and even tutor your child in if you wish. If any of the above sounds like it might fit your needs - great! I look forward to hearing from you!",

I am currently pursuing a business course and am deeply committed to contributing to the success and progress of my family. I am seeking my next opportunity as a nanny with a wonderful family.\n\nMy experience in caring for infants, toddlers, and youth began at the age of 14 when I started helping friends and family during emergencies. Over time, I expanded my experience by promoting my services locally and have been working as a caregiver for at least 6 years. I am also CPR certified.\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy walking my dogs and going to the gym. I am eagerly looking forward to finding the next family that I will have the privilege to work with. Thank you for taking the time to read through my bio. I hope we have the opportunity to connect soon.",
