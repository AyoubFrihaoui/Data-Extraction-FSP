I was born and raised on the Upper West Side in Manhattan and went to the Calhoun School for 14 years. I genuinely love working with kids and love finding families I can establish a longstanding relationships with.\n\nMy education background has provided me with a thorough understanding of child development and I hope to pursue a JD or MSW. During my undergraduate career I was employed as a tutor at New London High School, a social work intern at Jennings Elementary School, and a GED tutor to incarcerated women at York Correctional Institution. I was also a barista and hiring manager at the college cafe; I make a mean latte. I currently serve as the Teacher Community Manager for an education startup.\n\nI'm currently working as a full-time nanny for an amazing toddler. But please do be in touch if you're looking for someone - my schedule may change! \n\nBest, Talley",

She created a safe, fun, and loving environment, and I always felt at ease knowing my little one was in such capable hands.

In addition to my 7 years of experience, I grew up being the oldest sibling/cousin so I have been a built-in babysitter since I was very little! I am very patient and reliable especially when it comes to children. I have experience with all ages as I have had the privilege of watching all of my younger family members grow. I'm a very cleanly person, so light to medium house keeping isn't an issue for me, as well as helping your child with school work. I am most comfortable working with 1-2 children but I have also worked with up to 13 at a time as I was a camp counselor for two consecutive summers at Driftwood Day Camp. I have a dog of my own so I am very comfortable with pets. I can feed them, walk them etc! Child enrichment has always been an important concept of mine, as I strongly believe the kids are our future! I would love to help build a fun & safe environment for your kid(s) to thrive in!",
