With over three years of experience, I've had the privilege of caring for children of various ages. My approach centers on patience, creativity, and respect for household rules. I prioritize open communication with parents, providing regular updates and following their preferred methods.\n\nI'm comfortable caring for two children at a time and am happy to assist with tasks such as cooking, light housekeeping, travel, and supervising swimming activities.\n\nWhen it comes to playtime, I enjoy engaging children in outdoor sports, board games, puzzles, and educational games that foster their development.\n\nI'm excited about the opportunity to connect with your family and provide exceptional care for your child.",
