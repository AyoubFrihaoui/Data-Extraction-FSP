Additionally I have a lot of experience with my nephews and nieces from birth to teen. I love being with the kids and their limitless imagination. That's why I want to keep working with them. I have valid driver license with a clean record and I have a car, so distance is not a problem. I know CPR for kids. I'm fully vaccinated and pet friendly. I'm a green card holder so I'm legal to work so either cash or check works for me. Also no problem with traveling abroad. \n\nIf you interested please contact me.

I am genuinely passionate and love working with children. As the eldest child in my family, I was a caretaker for my two younger siblings. Caretaking is something I am naturally good at and love doing, as I have been doing it almost my whole life.\n\nI am a graduate student at Columbia University pursuing my masters in Nursing.\n\nI hope we can connect, and I want to positively impact your children's lives.",
