My everyday is creating fun games, teaching new crafts, and helping out in any way I can :) With my experience also comes plenty of energy, love, toys, and stickers for everyone (even you, grown-up)!! I am open to childcare, cooking, cleaning the home, and caring for pets. My own pet experience ranges from farm animals to exotics so any baby in my care would receive knowledgeable attention and plenty of belly rubs (if applicable!). Let me know if you have any questions or would like to set up an introduction! CPR and BLS certified. Current Associates degree in Science and Art - Bachelors of Psychology in progress.",
