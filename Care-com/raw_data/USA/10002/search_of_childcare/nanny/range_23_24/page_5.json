I started babysitting local kids around my neighborhood at the age of 12 and fell in love with it ever since. I have been working with child in the city as a nanny, babysitter, preschool teacher, dance instructor, and after school aid!. \nI'd describe my personality as fun, extroverted, and energetic!\nI like working with kids because I love being exposed to their innocence while living in such an intense city. I want to be able to help the next generation of child become the best versions of themselves.\nI'm looking for a job that suits my busy schedule while also being available last minute for parents that need a litttle extra help! \nIn my spare time, I like to play video games and take care of my puppy!\nOne thing you should know about me is that I am professional theatre performer and dancer! \nMy skills include ability to work with child on the spectrum, good at relating to children's interest, and able to drive to locations.",

I have a background in mathematics (Associates) and film/TV (NYU, on hold). Currently a finance professional working FT in Dumbo and presently seeking part-time opportunities with being a caretaker (senior, children and pets). \n\nAs for my experience with:\n\n*Children: I have 3 nieces and 3 nephews between the ages of 4-15 who I have assisted caretaking for on behalf of my sisters between their birth to present.\n*Seniors: I cared for my maternal grandparents for two years... and until their end-of-life (hospice). \n*Pets: have plenty of my own... I love them and they love me.\n\nThe current work I do isn't particularly satisfying my needs to help others and I am on the hunt to build a part-time career doing so. I have immense appreciation for caretaking and I am very much looking forward to working together!\n\nHappy to share more about me if needed. :)\n\nNatalia",

Meaning I have a bit of time under my belt! I have cared for children from newborn to 12 professionally, as well as children with special needs. Additionally, I have worked as a housekeeper in a convent so that added help for a family always comes easy. I hope to share a dynamic, comfortable, and warm environment with the children I care for and their families.

I have been nannying for almost 6 years now and have experience looking after children from six months to 12 years old. Every child I look after is my favorite child, from the gummy smile of an infant to the rambunctiousness of a toddler to the all-knowing maturity of an adolescent.\n\nMy approach to nannying is to keep it active. Arts and crafts, museum trips, cooking, singing, cleaning: I do it all and I value it all. Screen time is best kept limited and meaningful. My first job was as a lifeguard, so I am CPR certified and have first-aid training. I have also been studying French for over 10 years.\n\nWhile I am a naturally affectionate and effusive human being, warm and fun and down-to-earth, I am also a book lover, former tutor, and dedicated scholar with an energetic approach to learning. I make sure the studying is diligent and the homework gets done on time. Hope to hear from you soon!",
