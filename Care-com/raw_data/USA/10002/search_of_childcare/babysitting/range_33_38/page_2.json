With 10 years of experience, I'm comfortable caring for up to three children of varying ages. I'm patient, creative, and friendly, easily connecting with children.\n\nEffective communication with parents is essential to me. I follow their preferred method, whether it's verbal communication during pickup, regular text updates, or phone calls. Regarding household rules, I take my cues from the parents, ensuring consistency for the children.\n\nMy favorite part about being a nanny is playing with the children. We enjoy outdoor sports, board games, puzzles, and educational games that promote learning. I'm also a skilled swimmer and would love to teach your children how to swim.\n\nI have First Aid and CPR training. I can help with cooking, meal preparation, carpooling, light housekeeping, and travel. I speak English and I'm a non-smoker.",

Creativity is an important part of my own personal growth and development, and I would love to share the joys of arts and crafts, dancing, and music with any kids I have the privilege of looking after. \n\nIn my free time, I enjoy writing songs and spending time with my 4-year-old retired racing greyhound, Oscar!

I'm McKenna. \n\nI recently quit my Big Tech job to start my own consulting business, and I am looking for part-time work as a nanny or babysitter as I build my revenue. \n\nI absolutely love children and take a lot of joy in helping parents out while getting to know their kids. I babysat and nannied for over 10 years in Ohio. When I moved to New York, I went to college and then worked in journalism for 5 years. Now, as I build my business, I'm ready to return to childcare. \n\nI am really flexible with my hours and my time commitment. I can help with errands, groceries, online school, and more. I also am proficient in Spanish and speak a bit of Turkish, if you want me to work on some vocab with your little ones. \n\nIdeally, I'd like to work together on a recurring basis so I can get to know your family and your needs to provide the best care possible.",

My previous babysitting roles reinforced my desire to make a positive impact on children's lives. With a patient and creative approach, I strive to provide a safe and fun environment for your kids. I believe in open communication with parents, ensuring that I follow your preferred method to discuss their child's day and address any concerns. As for household rules I prefer to follow what the parents feel is best for their children. \n\nI'm a child at heart and genuinely enjoy engaging in playtime with the kids I babysit. We typically find ourselves outside at a park or playing sports, lots of arts and crafts (including science experiments), playing pretend and dress up! With my First Aid Training, you can trust that your children are in safe hands. I am happy to assist with light housekeeping and travel if needed. I'm a student so we'll have to chat about scheduling!",
