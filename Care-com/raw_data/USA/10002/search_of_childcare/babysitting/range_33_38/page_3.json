I entered Boston College as a Music and Theater double major before switching to Sociology and Psychology. I completed one year at the Graduate School of Social Work with an emphasis on child life issues and early childhood development. Due to financial reasons I suspended my enrollment in grad school and worked full-time as a nanny for infant twins. I worked closely with their early intervention team to address cognitive and physical development issues. I continued to work with infants as well as multiples as my specialty but broadened my scope to all children ranging in age from newborn to 15 years of age working one-on-one or in group settings up to 12 children at a time. To supplement my hours as a nanny, I began teaching SAT prep with Kaplan and worked as a Mad Science teacher for after school and private events.",

In addition to my experience in the performing arts, I studied visual arts and I'm passionate about bringing these talents to my work with children. I have found that connecting through laughter and creativity has the power to build powerful bonds with kids. Everyone wants to feel seen and heard, and offering that presence to kids can have a profound impact on their confidence and self-esteem.\n\nI have cared for a very wide age range, including newborns, toddlers, and elementary school children. And have experience with food allergies and neurodivergent children. I currently work part-time with two wonderful, longtime families. I am open to both part-time and full-time work, as I'm interested in transitioning to a more traditional schedule.",
