I have about seven years of experience with babysitting/nannying. I have cared for children from ages as low as 2 months to 13 years. I also have extensive experience with disabled children. I have two autistic siblings, and I am a service provider for one. I am the second oldest of three kids, so I have cared for them for most of my life, and know how to deal with different types of kids. I have also done several children theater camps, so I have a few tricks up my sleeves on how to entertain super hyper and energetic children. I love coming up with outdoor activities and doing arts and crafts! I also have worked with the charity \"Champions are Readers\" for about two years now. Through this charity, I go to schools to teach little kids how to read, so I am definitely a big lover of reading and encouraging it in children.",

I work part-time at MSG but it's very flexible. I have been babysitting since I was around 14 years old and that includes infants, children with special needs, and allergies. I have experience tutoring, teaching music lessons, caring for animals, and helping with homework. I was also a full-time nanny for 2 years!\n\nI'm a very creative person so I would love to do arts and crafts, games, dancing, etc. with the kids. \n\nMy hobbies include musical theatre, anything outdoors, art, and volunteering occasionally. At Rider I was involved in The Rider News, Baccalaureate Honors Program, BroncVision, Dance Ensemble, Relay For Life, and performing arts. \n\nI'm fully vaccinated, CPR + first aid trained, and have completed early childhood education coursework. \n\nPlease reach out if I'm a good fit! :)",

This past summer I was a nanny to a 6-month-old baby and watched him Monday-Friday from 8 a.m.  to 6 p.m.  every day. I am very comfortable with animals as I have a dog myself and would feel perfectly fine looking after and caring for a pet in a household I am working in. I am very reliable and can supply multiple references from past families I have cared for. I am also First Aid certified and took a class my sophomore year of college on how to care for infants as well as children in danger.\nBTW I don't know why it says located in Los Angeles, CA, I have tried to change it, but it doesn't let me.

I enjoy coming up with creative and engaging activities that support their development and keep things fun. Communication is really important to me I make sure children feel comfortable expressing their emotions and needs, and I provide regular updates to parents in their preferred way. I'm also comfortable setting any rules or boundaries enforced by the parents and can help with light housekeeping. I love playing a variety of games that cater to different interests. I am also CPR trained. I look forward to getting to know your family and providing great care for your child!",

I am currently employed as a software engineer and work remote from my home in the Tribeca area!\n\nThroughout highschool I babysat for a couple of families. I babysat a 2-year-old until she was around the age of 4, and her baby brother from just after he was born. I only stopped babysitting for this family when I moved to another state. I would babysit these children in their home or take them on excursions, like to the park or indoor jungle gym. I grew up in a family of 4 children and was the second oldest. My younger siblings are 5-8 years younger than me so I also always helped out watching over them as they grew up. I am comfortable babysitting a child of any age and my schedule is flexible!\n\nI also volunteer and teach children how to code so I would definitely be able to help your children with their homework should they need help",
