My journey in childcare began with fulfilling babysitting roles, where I discovered my natural ability to connect with children and make a positive impact on their lives.\n\nMy patient and calm demeanor, coupled with my creative and imaginative nature, allows me to engage children in a variety of activities that nurture their development. I believe in open and honest communication with parents, ensuring that they are fully informed about their child's day and any matters that arise.\n\nI'm more than comfortable enforcing household rules, ensuring a consistent and structured environment for the children in my care. From outdoor sports and physical games to board games and puzzles, I enjoy a wide range of activities that encourage learning and fun.",
