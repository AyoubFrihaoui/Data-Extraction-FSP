I grew up in Hawaii where I regularly babysat for many local families as well as occasionally tourists visiting at hotels. My mom was a Waldorf kindergarten teacher so I started babysitting very early on through connections at the school.\n\nI moved to Boston for college & continued babysitting for various families, often getting recommended to others. I've had several families whose children I've taken care of every week for 7-10 years & watched the kids grow from infants/toddlers to teens.\n\nI also ran my own children's camp where I had anywhere from 4-10 kids. I planned games, treasure hunts, arts & crafts & provided lunch & snacks.\n\nI also do quite a bit of pet sitting. I love animals & always make sure the house is kept as clean & put together as possible. \n\nHaving worked with so many different children & pets over the years I can confidently say I have the experience for whatever you may need. And I'll always make it fun :)",

Her presence with the kids was joyful and they loved having her in their lives. Miranda is creative and energetic and also a fantastic communicator and employee.

In undergrad, I wrote and performed for children in several Theater for the Very Young productions (focusing on children under 5 years old). \nI have a deep passion for all creative arts, and my portfolio spans acrylic paint, oil pastel, charcoal, clay, ukulele, found sculpture, jewelry making, embroidery, crochet, needle felting, and whatever other materials I can get my hands on! \n\nI am currently on school break until the end of January.",
