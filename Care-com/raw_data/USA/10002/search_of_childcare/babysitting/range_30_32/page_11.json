I grew up helping with my two younger siblings and have managed groups of up to six children at a time in a professional setting.\n\nMy approach is warm and fun--I love engaging kids through creative play, outdoor activities, and storytelling. As a longtime camp counselor, I was honored to be voted \"Favorite Counselor\" every year. Still holding onto those bragging rights!\n\nA little about me: I love movies, music, baseball, basketball, and dancing! Whether your child loves imaginative play, sports, or arts and crafts, I'm excited to help them learn and grow while having fun. I'd love to chat and see if I'm the right fit for your family! Let's schedule a phone call soon.",

Naturally, children are incredibly fearless and imaginative individuals, and I love nurturing and cultivating these important traits.\nIn every job, I seek safe environments where I can be authentic and creative. I aspire to be part of a home that is loving and nurturing. I am looking for families that are close-knit and kind, not only to themselves but also to the people they welcome into their homes. I am seeking a job where there is a mutual level of respect for both parties, along with an open-door policy allowing individuals to be honest and expressive about any concerns or questions. | began working with kids when I was 13 years old, and some of my best moments have been spent among children. In my spare time, I enjoy reading, taking photos, listening to music, connecting with nature, and indulging in pizza.",
