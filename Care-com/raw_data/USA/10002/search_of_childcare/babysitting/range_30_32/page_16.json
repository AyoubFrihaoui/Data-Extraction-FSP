Although they don’t see each other often because I only travel to New York occasionally, Maria is always a reliable and trustworthy person to leave the kids with when I’m away.

I want to ensure that I am remaining proactive and energetic in my everyday schedule which is why I am looking for a summer job. I have two young sisters ages 12 and 9 that I consistently babysat for throughout high school and college. During this time, I also volunteered at Camp ANCHOR which is a camp that provides recreational and social opportunities for individuals with developmental and physical disabilities. I then went on to graduate with my BSW from WCU in 2018 and my MSW from NYU in 2019. All of this experience and education has equipped me with the tools needed for this position.",

After this experience, I moved to America and worked as an au pair for over a year taking care of a 6-month-old baby and a 2-and-a-half-year-old. I'm glad to say I'm still in touch with the family, and I still travel sometimes to take care of their children. \n\nI would love to connect and see if I can be a good fit for your family!",

I've also worked as a counselor for a summer youth program at a daycare, caring for children from newborns to 5 years old. Additionally, I've worked with children ages 5-18 and assisted my aunt with her three children.\nPreviously, I worked as a paraprofessional for the Department of Education, supporting children with autism and other special needs. I'm now seeking a full-time position that allows for a more personalized, one-on-one experience with children. I firmly believe that trust and communication are essential in any childcare setting. I'm fluent in Spanish and excited to bring my skills and experience to a new role.
