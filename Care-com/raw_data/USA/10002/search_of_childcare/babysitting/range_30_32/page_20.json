I have been baby-sitting now since I was in middle school, so well over 10 years. I have officially been a nanny for about 10 years now and I was live-in for 2 of those years. I started with a family in Westchester and I have been working in NYC for over 8 years. I am comfortable working with all ages, but my last several jobs have been with early to late elementary school aged children ranging between ages 7-14. I could very well stick with this age, or it might be nice to change it up and work with younger children again. I am CPR certified, I am a great cook, love to bake cookies, I am excellent at making up songs on the spot. I also strongly believe in being polite, having great manners, and perhaps most importantly being kind.",
