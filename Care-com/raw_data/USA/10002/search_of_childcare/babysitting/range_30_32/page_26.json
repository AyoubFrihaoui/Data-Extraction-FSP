In addition to nannying, I've worked in daycares, and taught art classes in after-school programs and summer camps. Over the past year I've worked for several families in Brooklyn providing care for infants (as young as 3 months), and toddlers. I'm very comfortable with multiples and am open to every child's individual needs. As a care provider, safety is my upmost priority, followed by having fun and embracing creativity. Families I've worked with have described me as patient, warm, and flexible.\n\nA little bit about me- I'm in my 30's, and in addition to being a nanny, I'm a professional visual artist working with a gallery in NYC. I grew up alongside a neurodiverse family member and have experience teaching art to neurodiverse adults, teens and children. I'm also a very active person and love being outside at Prospect Park and the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.",

Having extensive experience with all ages between infancy and adolescence, I am still consistently thrilled to experience the myriad ways that we can support their development. My first paying job was babysitting for children in the neighborhood, but the real foundation of my experience in intentional childcare was working at a summer camp in a local nature preserve. My experience includes running elementary-aged outdoor programs, nonprofit community programs for teenagers, and most recently, working in the Infant/Toddler program at a Montessori school. I love to encourage agency- regardless of age, all young people benefit from the opportunity to make mistakes within a safe set of boundaries. My greatest strength is my authenticity, engaging with all children carrying a sense of curiosity and wonder.",

I have many years of experience with children working in multiple capacities, including babysitting, early literacy tutoring, and as a full-time teacher.

I absolutely love what I do and always make it a goal to keep children entertained, well-fed, clean, and most importantly, safe. It is vital to create a comfortable relationship with the child and families, allowing them to know I am a reliable, patient, and responsible adult. I maintain a fun and engaging environment. I believe children learn through play and I always encourage their minds to explore and discover, as they grow. I enjoy dress-up, super heroes, Arts and Crafts, reading and more! I enjoy being outdoors, playing sports, riding bikes, & playground visits- weather permitting. I can assist with homework and tutoring. I am available for date night and occasional sitting. Thank you!",

I also respect and adhere to the household rules set by the parents.\n\nMy approach to childcare involves a mix of outdoor activities, board games, and educational games that foster learning and fun. I'm dedicated to providing a nurturing and enriching experience for each child in my care.\n\nI am fluent in both Arabic and English and am comfortable caring for up to two children at a time.",
