I worked with the same family for little more than a year and then we became very good friends. Now I'm living here in New York and I'm looking for a good family! \nI love working with kids, I'm originally from Colombia and I can teach the kids Spanish if you need. \nI can prepare meals to the kids, (not afraid to change diapers). I'm also pet lover. Some dogs and cats can cause me allergies but If a keep washing my hands everything will be fine. \nThanks for reading, hope to meet you soon!",

I have been wilderness advanced first aid certified, and I am in the process of renewing my CPR certification. I do not smoke. I have experience babysitting infants and toddlers, and extensive experience working with kids aged 7-17 at an overnight camp. I also volunteered at the daycare connected to my high school all throughout high school, and took a part time position with them after graduating during the summers. During the pandemic I worked as a camp counselor at a day camp with groups aged 5-9. I am currently located in Manhattan. I am fully vaccinated and boosted! I love reading, arts and crafts, and spending time outside. I am a very outgoing and bubbly person, so if you think I would be a good match for your child please feel free to reach out to me! I am looking forward to meeting you.",
