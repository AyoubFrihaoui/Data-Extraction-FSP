I personally believe that when taking care of kids, you must be empathetic and in tune with their needs and perception of the world, so it doesn't feel like the babysitter is here right now, but one of their besties are. There is so much to learn from children and I find it endlessly fascinating watching the different developmental stages. After doing this for quite some time, I think I've found the perfect balance between following the parents needs, but still making it a fun hangout for the kids. \n\nBecause I work full time, I'm looking for babysitting gigs rather than a full time nanny schedule.\n\nIn my spare time, I like to create various art projects with friends, even just for kicks. I really enjoy spending time with literally any one's pet, reading, and going to flea markets.\n\nMy skills include cooking, getting them to bed on time (especially the summer to school transition, not an easy feat), creative play",

I'm looking for a full time gig while I study for my certification exam and await credentialing at a hospital system (about 6 months). Due to my extensive medical training, I consider myself to be great fit as a caregiver for children. I'm incredibly responsible, nurturing, great with children and love to laugh & have fun! Additionally, I grew up babysitting my little cousins and kids around the neighborhood. After working with children throughout my medical rotations, I'm actually considering going into Pediatrics!",
