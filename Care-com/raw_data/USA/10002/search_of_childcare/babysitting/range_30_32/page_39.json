My hours are flexible - doesn't need to be the same every week but can be.

I love to play, teach, walk/run and basically be kids with them. I take my job very serious and follow all rules and I make sure I reinforce them.

                    "experienceSummary": "Hi I'm 28 from Germany - I love kids and like to see them grow up healthy and smart. I have CPR certification and a degree in Education and early childhood Psychology + qualified working with infants +10 years work experience. I'm fully vaccinated. I'm very organized and responsible. I'm a perfectionist about my job and have great attention to detail. I'm very calm and well mannered. I have worked for families of diverse cultures/religions/ethnicities. In my spare time, I like meeting up with friends, being active or just hanging out at home watching movies. I also love cooking and baking. I have a driver license and a clean driving record. I'm a good and safe driver, did my license 2014 in Germany and am comfortable driving in the city too. Consider myself a caring, understanding, patient, really responsible child care giver, flexible and outgoing person. I can provide local references as well from previous families. I don't have my own car. Live in or live out.",
