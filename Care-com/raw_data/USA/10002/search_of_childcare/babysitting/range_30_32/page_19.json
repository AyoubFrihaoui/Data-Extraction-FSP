My goal is to spread positivity, encourage the kids to see the bright side of things, and all while using my comedy skills to keep them giggling throughout the day!\n\nI've nannied in CA and I've worked with many families in NYC for 11 years. I've had permanent nanny jobs while also freelancing with 30+ families! I have experience with all ages between 4 months to 13 years old.\n\nI want to make sure every child feels appreciated and leaves with a smile on their face with a strong belief in their own capabilities! I'm vaccinated. \n\nI do a 4 hour minimum payment per booking, 4 hr minimum payment for 48hr cancellations or full pay if it is 24hrs (includes if the child/family is sick within 48 hrs then the cancellation fee will follow) as it can be difficult to find last minute work. Full pay for days where hours are shortened. \n\nI look forward to speaking with you!",

I'm a career artist, and supplement my income as a nanny and tutor. My first nannying job in NYC turned into 7 years with the same family (and a lifelong bond), and my second long-term job lasted 5 years. Both positions turned into a tutoring role as the kids got older and advanced in school; this included virtual learning when the pandemic began. I take my role as a caregiver seriously - I understand I'm not only responsible for providing structure and guidance, but most importantly to lead by example. I'm a huge advocate for reading and creativity! I love doing crafts/projects and encouraging independent interests. It is a privilege to witness the growth of a child, and even more so to stimulate emotional development as their personalities and interests emerge.",
