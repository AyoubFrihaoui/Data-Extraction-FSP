I love children and I have always wanted to have a career that would allow me the opportunity to make a difference in children's lives. My \"Sitting\" style can be described as Professional, Reliable, and Fun! I am a true believer in positive reinforcement and team work. Therefore, I make it important to have open dialogue with not only the child(ren) involved, but the parents as well. We're all in this together and although this is a job to me, I would love to become part of your family also. \n\nMy hobbies are: Cooking, (I can make just about anything.) Writing, and yoga. \n\nI hope to have the opportunity to work with your family and make a difference in your children's lives.",

Over the last decade I've had countless childcare jobs, whether it be as a live-in for families of multiples, for families with infants, managing the Performing Arts department of a summer camp with up to 600 kids ages 7 to 16, tutoring and caring for children with Autism and Williams Syndrome, directing children in plays and musicals, accompanying families to weddings/special events, the list goes on! Additionally, I have specialized experience with children who have experienced grief, and have assisted with remote learning. \n\nI'm fully vaccinated, welcome housework, and am comfortable with travel. Currently, I'm looking for Full-Time work with one family.\n\nI love learning more about the world through kids, engaging them in play, and just being an asset to a family however I can. :)",
