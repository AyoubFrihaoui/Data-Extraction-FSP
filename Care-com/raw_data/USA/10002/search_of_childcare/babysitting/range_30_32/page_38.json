My first experience working with children was in 2010 as a teaching assistant at ABC Echo Park Children and Family Center. I was responsible for 7-10 infants/toddlers, at a time, and ensured that they were engaged with games, songs, and stories. \n\nThroughout high school and college, I often baby sat for family, friends and my teachers.\n\nI was also a residential advisor on campus throughout my education. I organized activities that encouraged community bonding and problem solved for unexpected emergencies. When I graduated from undergrad, I worked as counselor at Life Dome Adult Services in Mount Vernon; assisting children with disabilities, ages 5-10, with their academic and social skills. \n\nI currently work at NBC News as a reporter.

I enjoy playing all kinds of games with kids, from sports and physical games to board games and puzzles. I even love educational games that promote learning.\n\nI'm comfortable caring for up to two children, and my experience ranges from newborns to preteens.

I plan on going back for my Masters in Social Work. My experience over the years started when I was 15 taking care of children. Currently I am working as Case Manager for migrant families and was previously working as Behavior Tech for autistic children. I've also had experience being a babysitter, Teacher's Assistant at a daycare and tutoring for both grade school and college level. Outside of work, in my spare time, I like to read and spend time with family and friends.\nI am hoping to contribute and being an integral part of your family, any questions please feel free to contact me!",

I graduated from University of Massachusetts with a degree in business. I've always loved kids and had a natural ability to care for them. I began babysitting in my teenage years and had a recent nanny position in college. I cared for an infant for about a year & half, the family have now became life long friends! I have experience in feeding, changing, burping and nap time with babies. I'm a big fan for crafts, reading books, taking walks and keeping the kids busy ( not just in front of the tv). Although, I am a huge fan of Disney movies! I come from a big, Polish, close knit family. So, if you're looking for a very warm-hearted person then I'm your girl. My career allows for my schedule to be very flexible from week to week. I'm vaccinated and take precautions to stay safe. Overall, I'd treat your bundle of joy as if they were my own.

My patient, calm, and friendly nature allows me to connect with children and create a safe and nurturing environment. I believe in open communication with parents and follow their preferred methods to discuss their child's day or any concerns.\n\nI am comfortable enforcing household rules while following the parents' guidance. My approach to playtime includes a mix of outdoor sports, board games, and educational games that encourage learning. I'm comfortable caring for up to two children of varying ages, from infants to preteens.\n\nMy commitment to safety includes First Aid Training and CPR Training. Additionally, I'm an experienced swimmer with lifeguard training/experience. I hope to have the opportunity to support your family and provide reliable childcare for your precious little ones.",
