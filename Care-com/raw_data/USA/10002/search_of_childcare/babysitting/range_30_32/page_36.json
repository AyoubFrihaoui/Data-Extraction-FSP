She was responsible, punctual, organized, great with the children (8 and 10 at the time) and just a genuinely kind and lovely person. She could walk that fine line between being firm enough to get the children to listen to her while still making them feel supported and cared for. She is very receptive to feedback and easy to communicate with. She was with us during home schooling due to the pandemic. It was such a difficult time for everyone and we could not have survived those chaotic times without her. Even years later, we continue to keep in touch. She is a big sister to my girls.

I am very happy working weekends. \n\nI am great with kids. I grew up with siblings 12 years younger than me and have previous experience as a tutor and camp counselor, so I am very comfortable with children of all ages. I have also babysat for other families in the past in my neighborhood. I am fun and easygoing, but also can stick to a schedule. If your child is older and would like any help with reading, writing or other tutoring, I would be happy to do so as well. I also have a dog (small dachshund, very friendly). If you have dog walking needs I am happy to accommodate that too!",
