I've also spent time tutoring younger students and teaching preschool, which has honed my patience, creativity, and ability to keep kids entertained and learning. \n\nI'm a big fan of music and love incorporating sing-alongs or age-appropriate dance parties into playtime. I enjoy exploring green spaces with the kids I care for (if allowed) and fostering a connection with nature in the heart of the city. I have previously worked as a lifeguard, so I have been CPR/AED certified. If you have pets, no problem!\n\nOne thing you should know about me is I am super dependable and responsible, I love helping to shape the new generation and providing a positive influence where I can, and I'm confident that my experience, enthusiasm, and dedication to fun and learning would be a great fit for your family.",

I started babysitting at the age of 14 where the families I sat for had me responsible for feeding their children breakfast, lunch and dinner (I love to cook), taking them outdoors for walks or to the park/pool and helping with summer school workbooks along with light house keeping. After graduating from PSU with a BS degree in Economics I started as a part time nanny for a 5month old. I met this family on care. com and they have since become family. On the two days I was not nannying I was substitute teaching in both mainstream and special education classes. I then moved to Nashville where I was a full time Nanny for 3 children age 6, 10 and 12. I held the role of a \"paid stay-at-home mom\" groceries, laundry, errands, after school activities and cooking each night for the family. Please feel free to message me with any questions.",

She helped around the house and was able to flex and work around the chaotic environment in our home. I was working from home and supporting a 1st grader with online learning. Megan took on helping the preschooler with remote preschool. Megan could shift and shuffle to keep the 1st grader busy and fed between school calls and self-lead learning AND keep the preschooler away from me while I worked and away from the first grader and I while we did the remote 1st grade. She helped support the pets (dogs, cats, guinea pigs, and rabbit) in the home as well. Also, she helped with some home-improvement work while the kids and I were out of town for a few weeks. Would recommend Megan for any family looking for date-night and/or more regular care!",
