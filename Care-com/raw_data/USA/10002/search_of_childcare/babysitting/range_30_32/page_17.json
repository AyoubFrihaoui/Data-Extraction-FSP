My warm and approachable personality allow me to easily connect with kids and build strong relationships. I am a great listener and I am exceptionally comfortable with enforcing household rules, and having open communication with parents. \n\nI enjoy educational games that promote learning and critical thinking like any type of puzzle that will engage and entertain children. I also enjoy taking neighborhood walks, or playing with children at the park when weather permits. \n\nI can provide Early Childhood Education (ECE) coursework, Child Development Associate (CDA) certification, and training in First Aid and CPR, and references upon request!",

Later, I excelled as a substitute teacher in Montessori preschools, fostering independence and effective communication. Additionally, I have experience as a dedicated nanny for a 4-year-old and 12-year-old. I'm genuinely excited about the prospect of becoming a part of your family's journey. Understanding the significance of a nurturing environment, I'm committed to fostering it.

I have worked in a multitude of diverse settings with youth for over 8 years as an infant babysitter, nanny, dance teacher, after school program coordinator, tutoring site director, and art camp counselor. My most recent work situated me as an early childhood educator at a nature-based preschool program on Kauai. I simultaneously worked with homeschooled children (ages 5-8) leading enriching curriculum including outdoor explorations and farm adventure days. I find immense joy in working with children and have recently relocated to Brooklyn as I pursue a PsyD within a Child Psychology program.

She has helped us consistently take care of our two kids, ages 4 and 1, but I'm sure we would be great with any ages. She is beyond trustworthy and caring, and handles every aspect of scheduling, feeding, naptime, and playtime. Mostly, what we love about her is that she seems to genuinely enjoy spending time with children and getting to know what's fun for our kids. She is flexible and easy to communicate with. I can't recommend her enough!",
