Most recently I've been a nanny for 2 kids ages 7 and 10 until they moved recently. Prior to that job I was with 2 kids ages 3 and 5. I have 8+ years of experience working with kids of all ages. I worked in a daycare for 3 years and 1 year as a head preschool teacher with toddlers aged 15 months to 3 years old as well as infants from 3 months to 15 months. Duties required were meal prep, diapers, potty training, etc. I have been a camp counselor for 4 years with ages 4-12. I have also assisted and taught dance in New York City for five years with kids from 4 years old to 12 years old which required lots of patients and energy. I am CPR and First Aid certified. Please contact me with any questions and I look forward to hearing from you!\nThanks, \nHannah",

Tutoring is a strong skill that I started developing in high school with my peers and continue improving amongst all ages. Prior to tutoring, I've babysat for family members and friends because of my trustworthiness. Kids operate and grow differently so when it comes to childcare, properly knowing and respecting them as individuals will allow them to freely express themselves. It enhances interactions and creates positive impacts. When kids feel accepted and valued as themselves, they are more likely to engage positively and confide in someone they trust. This allows them to develop confidence and emotional resilience, which allows me to better understand their needs and provide appropriate support when necessary.",

                    "experienceSummary": "Hi! I'm Imani, a 19-year-old college student with a passion for working with children and providing a safe, fun, and nurturing environment. I've been babysitting for five years, caring for kids of all ages (from toddlers to pre-teens) and I absolutely love it. In addition to my experience, I'm certified by the American Red Cross in Babysitting and Childcare, which has helped me develop strong safety protocols and first aid skills.\n\nI bring a range of skills to my childcare work, including problem-solving and critical thinking, which help me stay calm and resourceful in any situation. I'm adaptable and able to keep kids engaged, whether it's with creative activities, homework help, or outdoor play. Above all, I believe in being empathetic and reliable-I want both the kids and parents to feel comfortable and confident in my care.\n\nI'm excited to bring my experience and enthusiasm to your family, creating a positive, supportive environment where kids can thrive!",
