I'm happy to say that I still have relationships with the families I have worked for and have gotten to see their children grow through the years. I enjoy doing arts and crafts, playing sports, and outdoor activities. I believe that it is important to create a fun, energetic, and educational environment for children. I have recently had a child and if I was able to bring her along I would happily negotiate hourly rate!",
