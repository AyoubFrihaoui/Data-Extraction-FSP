I started my caregiver journey with my younger siblings, when the parents needed me, I was always there to help. Further into my journey, I began babysitting for various friends and family. Now, I'm both a nanny and babysitter and have worked with several families within NYC. Most of my experience has been working with children from newborn to school age; I do, however, have some experience with teens. So, about myself, I enjoy going out for walks in the park and visiting the museum and library. I love singing, dancing, listening to music, and reading books to the kids. I am also an artist and enjoy creating anything possible in my free time, even when I'm with the kids. Overall, I'm the perfect nanny for families who prefer their kids to be unplugged and away from technology. I always do my best to redirect and find positive outcomes not only for the child but the family as a whole!",

Throughout high school and then college, Ive worked as a babysitter, and then nanny for multiple families. I've worked with children, toddlers, and infants. I've had experience with newborns as young as one week and kids as old as 12 years. I've watched kids of all ages, from all backgrounds with all different kinds of interests. I also have experience with children with special needs. I love music and singing, and have so much fun including this into my work! My most recent jobs are working in a daycare teacher in a pre-k setting with 3-4-year-olds. I left my daycare job to become a nanny, and currently I work for a wonderful family in Brooklyn with a 3-year-old girl and 11-month-old boy, who I have watched since he was a newborn. I am looking for jobs to supplement my income since I only work about 25 hours a week!",
