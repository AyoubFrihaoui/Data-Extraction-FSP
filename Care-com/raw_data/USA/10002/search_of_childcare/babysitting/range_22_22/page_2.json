I truly enjoy working with kids of all ages and have been with the same family for the past five years. They have one girl and two boys who are currently 5, 8, and 10 years old. I also helped raise my niece and nephew who are 8 and 10. I've loved being able to watch them all grow up! I have worked for several other families in the Tampa Bay Area and am happy to provide plenty of references.\n\nA little bit about me, in my free time I love to cook/bake, practice yoga, go to art museums, and explore new restaurants! I went to Florida State and graduated with my degree in Advertising in 2022. I always make sure to clean up around the house and am happy to help with any cooking needs! I'm a super outgoing and active individual.",

My name is Vivian, I'm 24, I graduated from NYU in May 2023, and I would love the opportunity to work with you and your family. Looking for part time or one time jobs only! \nMy primary employment has been in child care since I was 16 years old, and I absolutely love working with kids of all.\nI've been a swim instructor, overnight camp counselor, a part and full-time nanny, and a teacher's aid at a child care center. My junior year of college I worked as a tutor for in a 4th grade classroom. This was by far the most challenging and rewarding work I've done, as supporting a child in their direct education can be life changing. Now I babysit part time for a few different families!\n\nPlease don't hesitate to ask me any questions about my past employment and ANY concerns you might have! I am here to be flexible to your needs. I'm looking forward to this opportunity!",
