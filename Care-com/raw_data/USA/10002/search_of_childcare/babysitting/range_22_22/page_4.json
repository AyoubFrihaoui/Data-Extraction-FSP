I love children and think of myself as a very warm and compassionate person, understanding of different children's personalities, needs, and quirks. Finding creative and fun ways to spend time with children is a passion of mine! I will always prioritize safety and care along with fun, and am a capable cook and cleaner as well.

Originally from Milwaukee, WI, I currently attend Brigham Young University just outside Salt Lake City, UT, where I'm pursuing majors in psychology and global & community impact. My aspiration is to become a psychologist! \n\nOutside of academics, I'm passionate about the outdoors, reading, photography, and exploring new places. Being the second oldest of five children, I've been immersed in childcare since a young age, not only through babysitting for other families since I was 10 but also by assisting in caring for my younger siblings. Additionally, I have nannied for 4 different families, with children ages ranging from 1-13 years old.\n\nI'm naturally social and energetic, eagerly anticipating the opportunity to meet you!",

Having worked as a lifeguard throughout high school, I understand how crucial it is to maintain a safe environment. I am certified in CPR & first-aid, and I take great pride in the responsibility that comes with caring for others. I'm also always down to help with homework, especially English and History - two subjects I love! When I'm not working, you can find me watching movies, hanging with my cat, Pepper, or exploring the city with my friends.

I hope to be a performer and either a behavior analyst or psychologist for children with specific behavioral needs! I'm located in the UES and am willing to travel up to two miles. I've been babysitting for my friends, neighbors and family for over 4 years and have a true love for kids! I also am an elementary substitute teacher and specialize in teaching the kiddos who need a little more love. I have taught dance to elementary aged kids as well and I am also the assistant director of a recreational summer camp program. Teaching in different settings has given me a wide skillset when it comes to watching kids. I love coming up with crafts, telling stories and going on fun adventures with the kids! I am certified in CPR and first aid and also can cook and clean if needed. If you're in need of a sitter i'm a great match! Cant wait to chat! :)",

My name is Laney and I am a junior at the University of Iowa studying Psychology and Education Studies and Human Relations!\n\nI'd describe my personality as joyful, kind, and upbeat!\n\nI like working with kids because I love to connect with a child and allow them to grow in a supportive, loving, and joy-filled space. \n\nI'm looking for a job that is primarily in the summer, has clear communication with the parents, and playful, fun experiences with the kids!\n\nI started working with kids when I was 13, as a babysitter. I have been working in public schools for 3 years and in over-night summer camps for 5 years!\n\nIn my spare time, I like to listen to music, do yoga, paint, and spend time with people I care about most! \n\nOne thing you should know about me is that if I choose to do something, I am all in! 100% effort!\n\nMy skills include planning and facilitating specified activities for kids, in-the-moment problem-solving, and compassion for the child (kids have feelings too)!!",
