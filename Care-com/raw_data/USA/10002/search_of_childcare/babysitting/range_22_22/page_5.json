I have experience as a camp counselor, babysitter, and daycare worker, and am more than familiar and comfortable with child care. I can confidently ensure a nurturing, fun, and stimulating environment is provided for your kiddos. I'm a patient, trustworthy, responsible, caregiver who truly enjoys working with kids. I strive to help them smile, learn, and grow through practicing and modeling kindness, care, and compassion. From wind down to pick ups, and/or, meal prep to homework help, I would be delighted to proffer my assistance. My hobbies include biking, playing the violin, film photography, and arts & crafts. In addition to child care and homework/tutoring assistance, I can be of service with light housekeeping, and running errands. I take my responsibilities seriously, and would love to help make your job as a parent a little bit easier!",
