I have worked with very large families as well! I love to take kids on outings to parks, museums, zoos, and other activities. In the past I've been caregiver for a child with Down syndrome where I was responsible for changing his diapers, feeding, and bathing him. I've done several overnights as well! Most recently, I've provide care for a child with non-verbal autism. I have taken classes in child development, and assisted in middle and elementary classrooms! I spent this last summer caring for a child with autism as well! These experiences have helped me understand how to teach and care for children so we can all learn, try new things, and also have fun!",

I have experience working with children of all ages, ranging from 2 years old to 13 years old. I'm comfortable enforcing household rules and am happy to help with cooking, housekeeping, travel, etc. \n\nI love creating new activities & games for children to play which allow them to express themselves while learning. I am warm, nurturing, responsible, and disciplined. I always put 110% of myself into everything I do. \n\nI am open to any style of communication that works best for the parents/guardians to keep them updated on their child's day. \n\nI find so much joy in childcare, and will always put the safety and well-being of the child/children first.",
