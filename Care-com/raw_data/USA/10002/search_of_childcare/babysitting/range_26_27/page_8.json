I've watched up to four kids at once, so I'm well-prepared to care for multiple children. I currently work a full-time job, but I miss nannying and taking care of kids. I think it's fulfilling work, and I've had such incredible experiences with all of the families I have nannied for, so I'd love to work with yours!

I believe I am a natural born caregiver as I've always stepped into the nurturing role in my home and friend groups. Whether it be helping my mom grocery shop or my helping my friend organize her room, when my family and friends need me, I'm there to help. \n\nI started working with kids at just 13 years old. I was a summer camp counselor and then moved on to be a babysitter of an 8-month-old and 2-year-old. I babysat them for years and even went on to take them to school when they were in 1st and 5th grade. I later went on to teach music to children for 5 years and teach dance and acting to children with special needs for 3 years. \n\nI'm also such an animal lover and have had dogs my entire life. I have a Brittany, a high-energy hunting dog that loves hard and plays tug-of-war harder. I am very comfortable with dogs and truly love each one as my own.\n\n* There's a glitch with my reviews on Care. com but I have multiple references",
