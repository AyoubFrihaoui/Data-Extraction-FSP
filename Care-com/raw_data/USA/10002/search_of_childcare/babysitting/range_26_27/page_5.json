I love spending time with children and would love to spend as much time as possible with and around them in my free time. I am a great cook (can handle meal prep), can do laundry, like to organize, and love outdoor time. I enjoy arts and crafts, making puzzles, going to the park, and going for walks.\n\nI currently have a full time job where I work M-F 9-5 p.m.  as a Transmission Engineer for a renewable developer. I am only looking work after the hours mentioned and can help on the weekends and for date nights as well. I look forward to hearing from you!",
