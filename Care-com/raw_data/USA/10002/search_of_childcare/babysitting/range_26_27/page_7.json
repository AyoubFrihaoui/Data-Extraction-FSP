I am a hard worker, a good communicator and highly collaborative. I would describe my parenting style as a balance of nurturing, engaged, patient and loving with a good level of keeping structure and boundaries. Can assist with HW, activities, meal prep, housekeeping and/or pets. My goal is to carry out the plan/schedule you have in mind for your child and your home and to be as helpful to you as possible.

I enjoy creating a fun, safe and productive environment for kids. I'm good at keeping things organized and clean and a pretty good cook too (so I've been told lol ) . I'm great with kids of any age and dementor. Also I love animals so bring on the fluffy family members. I do have a car so picking up the kids and running errands are no issue.

My degree is in Musical Theatre, but I have been working in childcare since I was in middle school. Hailing from St. Augustine, FL, I began working at the Cathedral Parish Early Education Center as a classroom aid. In high school, I worked as a babysitter for local family friends and volunteered for the Special Olympics. Upon graduating high school and relocating, I took a small break from childcare, but resumed in 2021, working as a teacher. I am an independent contractor for Orange County Public Schools, specializing in performing arts workshops and education. I also worked at Central Florida Community Arts as a teaching artist for ages 3-18. I absolutely love working with children, and getting to help foster their creativity and growth is such a gift. I am a big fan of books, movies, dance parties, and puzzles!",
