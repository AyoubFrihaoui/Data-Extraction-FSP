I've also babysat and nannied for children from newborns to 12 years old.\n\nWhile I haven't had the chance to do night nannying yet, I'm familiar with it and open to the opportunity. I hold a certification in medical billing and coding, but I'm planning to return to school for my degree in early childhood education.\n\nIn my previous roles, I've provided lighthouse cleaning, meals, naptime, walks, playtime, and educational activities like reading, science experiments, and art. I've also handled school pick-ups and drop-offs. For infants, I focus on music, books, tummy time, feedings, diaper changes, and sleep training to help them meet developmental milestones.\n\nI am a non-smoker, fully vaccinated (with boosters), and pet-friendly! I'd love to meet your family and help care for your little ones. Thank you!",

If your kiddos are interested in cooking, baking, sewing/design, botany/foraging, woodworking, or anything outside then I'd be a great fit! I bring a play based learning mindset, my goal is to have fun and be a supportive friend to the kiddos I work with. I've worked with newborns-teens, twins, groups of 5. I love working with kiddos who have ASD, and have some ABA therapy experience. \nI'm happy to help with cooking/meal prep, laundry, housekeeping, errands, grocery shopping, and carpool.
