I grew up in a family of 4 and love my role as a big sister. My childcare experience expands across all age groups including children with special needs. Previously, I have worked as a summer nanny for a family of two. Additionally, I have also worked as a swim instructor and as an after school volunteer at a preschool. I enjoy being active, cooking, crafting and playing games. I also love animals so I am very happy to help with any pet care in addition to childcare. My hope in my time with you is to create a lasting impact through care, attention and fun. I cannot wait to meet your family!",

I am both CPR/First Aid Certified and I also have my Food Handler License.\n\n In addition, I have a background in the arts, having attended an arts school from 3rd grade to 12th grade, where I focused on vocal music. If your child has an interest in the arts, I would be delighted to provide guidance and support in that area as well.\n\nI'm excited about the opportunity to work with you all.\nThank You!",

My patient and friendly nature, coupled with my creativity, allows me to engage children of various ages.\n\nAs a caregiver, I prioritize open communication with parents. Whether through regular updates or our preferred method, I ensure you're informed about your child's day and any concerns that arise.\n\nWhile comfortable enforcing household rules, I believe in a balanced approach that fosters a nurturing environment. From outdoor sports to board games and educational apps, I enjoy a range of activities that cater to children's interests.\n\nI hold a graduate degree and have completed coursework in early child development. I'm trained in CPR and am fluent in both English and Portuguese. Besides childcare, I'm happy to help with light housekeeping tasks.\n\nI look forward to meeting you and your family!",

I see the importance of incorporating learning into play and I think they can be useful ways to connect and have fun with kids. I can also help with homework, making sure your child stays on track with their studies. Additionally, I can speak Spanish, which can be helpful if needed.\n\nI am also BLS/CPR and First Aid certified, ensuring your child's safety is always a priority.\n\nThank you for your time.
