She brings a unique blend of warmth, professionalism, and creativity to every babysitting session, making her an invaluable part of our family’s routine. Leila is not only reliable and punctual but also incredibly engaging with our kids, always coming up with inventive activities that are both fun and educational. Communication is one of Leila’s strong suits; she keeps us updated throughout the day, giving us peace of mind. It’s clear that Leila genuinely cares about our children’s well-being and development. We’ve seen our kids grow and learn new things, all while having a great time. We couldn’t ask for a better babysitter. Highly recommend Leila to any family looking for someone they can trust to take care of their kids with love, creativity, and utmost responsibility.",

My previous babysitting roles have reinforced my love for caring for children and inspired me to pursue a career in childcare.\n\nMy friendly and approachable nature allows me to connect easily with children, building trust and rapport. I believe in open communication with parents and regularly provide updates on their child's day, using their preferred method of contact.\n\nI am skilled at enforcing household rules while maintaining a positive and nurturing environment, always following the parents' lead. My favorite activities to engage children include outdoor sports, board games, puzzles, and educational games that promote learning and development.\n\nAs a multi-lingual individual, I am fluent in both Arabic and English.",
