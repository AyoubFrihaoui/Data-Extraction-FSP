I have always loved working with children since I began babysitting as a freshman in high school. Since then, I have annually volunteered at a one-week sleep away camp where I care for my assigned camper 24 hours each day during the week. This camp's mission is to support and positively impact disadvantaged children who often experience behavioral difficulties. I have extensive experience with children ages 6M-13 years old! I strive to keep children creatively entertained in a comforting and empowering environment with limited screen use. I am also very clean and would love to assist in any household chores, especially cooking. In the future, I hope to inspire both young children and teenagers in whichever field of work allows me to do so!",

I continued working with children since then. \n\nIn my spare time, I like to: write poetry and children's stories. \n\nOne thing you should know about me is that I am a Baptist Christian. \n\nMy skills include: creating physical, social, and intellectual activities for kids.",
