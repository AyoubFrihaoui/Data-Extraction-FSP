I have worked with children in London, Paris, Barcalona, and New York City, for over 20 years. With my experience, I have the unique skill set to work with a diverse population of all ages, ethnic backgrounds, and abilities.\n\nMy clientele include families with children attending, or applying to, Dalton, Epiphany, Trevor, and the Quad, or simply visiting the city for a holiday. I have personally stayed in touch with some of my roll models from Dalton for many year's, and hope to impact children to the same extent that my former teachers have had on myself. \n\nI give private lessons, offer homework help, and work on behavioral issues. I love seeing 'my' kids grow, expand their horizons, and learn to relish NYC as their own backyard. I enjoy taking children on field trips to museums and cultural events as much as to the playground.\n\nI often find myself working with families for multiple years.",

I am proud to say that I have been numerous families' first nanny, most having infants around 4 to 6-months-old when I started working for them. I specialize in caring for babies through age 7, but love to care for children of all ages.\n\nMy passions include traveling, social justice, and dancing. I love to explore and play outside, do arts and crafts activities, and spend time reading with the children I care for. I am proficient in French and Spanish.\n\nAlthough I do not have a car of my own, I would be happy to drive your children if you have a car to provide.

Since then, I have nannied for several infants & children throughout high school, college and grad school. My most long-term caregiving experience involved caring for a student at the George Washington University with spinal muscular atrophy: I helped with physical therapy, provided safe transport, administered medication, performed physical therapy, and did daily/nightly housework. In college, I was a licensed EMS provider and worked on the George Washington University EMS unit. I am also certified in CPR-pro. I continued to nanny while working full-time out east in the Hamptons. Since then, I have moved to Brooklyn and just finished my Master's of Science in TCM. I am currently studying for my board exams and looking for part-time nannying positions for the remainder of 2024.",
