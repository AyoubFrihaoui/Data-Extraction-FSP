I currently care for a family with 6 and 8-year-old girls and another with 1 and 4-year-old boys. We go to museums, parks, do homework and chores, etc. I have been a live in nanny, aupaired in Italy, Australia, and SF. I have facilitated children's camps, activities, and worked at a preschool. I understand that the role of childcare is more than just the children. I am assertive in seeing what else needs to be done around the house if the child is sleeping or busy. I have no issue driving kids around to various activities, homework help, arts and crafts, or whatever else you need! I am really friendly, outgoing, and active. Your child will not be bored. I am not someone who is on their phone. A review from an 8-year-old: \"You're the best babysitter because you always climb and run with us!\" I would love to set up a chat so we can see if we're a good fit.",

My focus is always on safety, fostering a fun and nurturing atmosphere, and encouraging children to grow with confidence. I work with kids of all ages, and I take pride in being reliable, organized, and adaptable to each family's unique needs.
