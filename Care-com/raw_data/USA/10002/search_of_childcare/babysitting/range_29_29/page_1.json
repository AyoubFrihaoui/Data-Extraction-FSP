I have over 7 years of professional experience in childcare and instruction. My experience began in 2015 with an Arabic class that I taught to kids ages 5-9. I taught the after-school class through 2017 and went on to work in a daycare through college as an aide. After graduating from UC Berkeley in 2020, I went on to work as a nanny and instructor with a private family. I facilitated the children's schoolwork and supervised their zoom sessions, and kept them on track with their remote schooling. \n\nAs the oldest of 3 girls and a cousin to many, I've grown up babysitting my whole life. Working with kids is my true passion in life, and it is my hope and goal to do so in my new home of New York!",

She even took a moment to check in on me, which made me pause and do the same for myself. Frances seamlessly stepped in at the last minute, allowing me to focus on my meetings stress-free. My children adored her so much that they even cried when she left. We will definitely be working with her again in the future.

I have experience caring for children of all ages, from infants to preteens. I'm particularly skilled at engaging children through imaginative play, physical activities, and educational games.\n\nI believe that open and honest communication is key to a successful childcare arrangement, and I make sure to keep parents updated on their child's day and any issues that arise. I'm comfortable enforcing household rules and routines and am confident in my ability to provide a safe and nurturing environment for children.\n\nIn my spare time, I enjoy spending time outdoors, reading, and playing board games. I have a valid driver's license and am comfortable with pets. I hope to have the chance to meet with you and discuss how I can best meet your family's childcare needs.",

I aim to help families continue to build a love of learning and feeling of security for their children. I believe that children thrive best in an environment that sets them up for success. I love sharing knowledge with children, guiding them through the new world that they encounter. I have a love of theater, nature, and making the world a better place- and I work to share that with every child in my care.
