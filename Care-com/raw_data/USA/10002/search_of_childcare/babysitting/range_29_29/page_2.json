I have 2 years of child care experience. Because I'm an Au pair in the past 2 years. I take care of twin in my first year, they are 14 years old, so I'm looks like a driver. And my second year stay in Chicago and need to take care of 3 boys. They are 3, 5and 7 years old. If needed, I'm available to teach your kids Chinese. I'm willing to do homework help, light housekeeping, laundry and light groceries shopping (because I don't have car). My schedule is flexible and if needed, can also work at weekends or early mornings. I'm patient, responsible, caring and looking forward to working with your kids. Also. I'm friendly with pets.

I have also worked for 2 companies throughout those years with many different families. I've had amazing experiences with infants since young, 13 years, started out with taking care of one of my cousins when he was a newborn. As time went by my passion for kids grew much stronger. The bond and relationship you build with them and trust they have in you is nothing short of amazing and I'd love nothing more than to continue my experiences with them. Lastly to say, I have been so blessed with an amazing and WONDERFUL 5-year-old daughter of my own!",

I have taught baby and me classes in the water and land. I can teach basic skills for soccer, basketball, baseball and tumbling. I am a swim instructor for 15 years. I like to take children to the park to play or meet their friends. I always try and leave the house clean and neat so when you get home there's nothing that needs to be done. I can cook and go to the store. I am certified in STEP strategic techniques for effective parenting and have used the skills for years at camp and with my own sons and others. I don't use reward and punishment but instead try and help the child's meet their needs in positive ways. Personally I like to ride my bicycle and my motorcycle. Happy to meet and see if we are a good fit.",

I was petrified of the thought of hiring a stranger to watch our 8 month old but Jasmine was amazing. She is in college and she came highly recommended by several professors who she babysits for on a regular basis. Her grandmother accompanied her on the interview to make sure we weren't weirdos (this actually made me feel better to know that she came from a loving caring family). The baby loved her! She sent me texts updates throughout the night so I didn't have to worry. Every time we put the baby in the pack and play to sleep, she would scream bloody murder but when Jasmine put her to sleep, she went to sleep without a peep! We call her the baby whisperer! She is great! Hire her!",
