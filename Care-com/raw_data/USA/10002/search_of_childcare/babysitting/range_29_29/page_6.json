From the very beginning, she felt like part of the family. Our kids absolutely adored her, and she created such a warm, supportive, and safe environment for them.\n\nYohannah has a special talent for connecting with children. She really got to know each of our kids and made sure to tailor activities to their interests and needs. Whether it was keeping our toddler busy with fun sensory play or planning creative crafts for our preschooler, she always made learning and playtime fun.\n\nShe’s also incredibly reliable and organized. Yohannah handled everything—meals, naps, school pickups—with ease and made our lives so much easier. On top of that, she kept the kids’ play areas and belongings tidy, which was such a bonus!\n\nWe’re so thankful for everything Yohannah has done for our family. Her kindness, patience, and genuine love for children made her such an amazing caregiver. While we’re sad to see her move on, we know she’ll be just as wonderful in her next role.\n\nIf you’re looking for a caring, dependable, and all-around fantastic nanny, we can’t recommend Yohannah enough!",

I worked as a lead toddler teacher at a private preschool, where I gained valuable skills in engaging and challenging young minds. Currently, I'm employed as a nanny for two kids, ages 5 and 9, and have developed a close relationship with the family over the past two years.\n\nMy typical duties include school drop-off/pick-up, assisting with homework, preparing healthy snacks, organizing playdates, and planning educational outings. I also help with light housework, run errands, and ensure the children's spaces are organized.\n\nOutside of my work, I love painting and enjoy arts and crafts projects. I make a point to spend as much time outdoors as possible, and I'm an avid reader. I'm looking forward to finding a new family where I can continue to provide loving care and enriching experiences for children.",

I have worked for the past six years as a dance teacher so I know how to capture a room, but I love capturing the heart of a kid I work with. We are a team - me, you, and your child. I have vast experience from working with children on the spectrum, to homework help, infant and toddler development, and have worked as a live-in nanny for families on vacation. With four years experience teaching parent-child movement classes, I love working and helping your little ones grow. I enjoy playing with all kids and hope to help in whatever way you may need. I look forward to hearing more about your family.",
