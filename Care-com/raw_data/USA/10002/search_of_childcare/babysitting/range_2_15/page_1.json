I have loved working with kids from a young age (going on 6 years of babysitting experience now), and have ample experience with children ranging from 1-year-old all the way through high schoolers. I have one younger brother and two baby sisters, and I have babysat them, driven them different places, and acted simultaneously as a motherly and sibling role model to them. If needed, I can assist in homework help for kids in school, and I can also play along with whatever activity your child wants to do. Due to my experience, I have an easy time connecting with, empathizing with, and communicating with children of all ages, and I would love the opportunity to provide you with a safe way to give both you and your kids a quality time! I'm very flexible schedule-wise and rate-wise, and am more than willing work with your needs. If needed, I can provide references, and I hope to get in touch!",

I often watch my neighbors children and drive them to and from daycare/dance classes etc. I am comfortable watching multiple children at a time and am willing to drive them places if need be. I also coached tennis clinics, which has given me a lot of experience working with children at all ages. The kids I teach and help assist vary from the ages 2-15. The experience I have gained from my past jobs have taught me a lot about how to teach kids and make them feel comfortable away from their parents during classes. From this I have worked for my boss and watched his kids, whether it is at home, his house, or taking them to the pool or classes. I am very artistic and love arts and crafts with kids!",

As a college student in school to be a pediatrician, I have ample experience as both a caregiver, and medical professional. I currently work as a Behavior Technician with children with Autism to help them learn behavioral skills and navigate the world. In addition to my RBT license, I am certified as an EKG technician, a CNA, and am currently completing my Child Development Associate credential. Indubitably, medical school is a very long journey, and as I complete that, different roles in both child and senior care have become both a hobby and passion of mine outside of the classroom. I have experience in a plethora of settings including in home childcare, classroom setting, daycares, summer camps, and nursing homes. I am extremely caring, understanding, and reliable, am fully vaccinated, and CPR trained for infants, children, and adults! Can also provide my professional resume upon request :)",

I excel at multitasking, building strong connections with both children and families, and creating a nurturing atmosphere. Certified in CPR and First Aid, I have specialized training in potty training, walking/crawling classes, and toddler development (Big Little Feelings). I am also experienced in introducing solid foods to infants as young as 6 months and supporting early developmental milestones like walking and crawling.
