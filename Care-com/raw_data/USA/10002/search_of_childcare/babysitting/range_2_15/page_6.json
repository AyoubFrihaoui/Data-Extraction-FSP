As a babysitter, the oldest child and as the mother of a 23-year-old. I have a lot of experience working mainly with toddlers and adolescents but have experience caring for infants as well. I truly love children and I approach each child as an individual I get to help grow and teach.\n\nPrior to taking on babysitting full time I worked as a home health aid for the elderly for 10 years. During this time I gained experience helping people with different special needs and also took the proper training and certification courses.\n\nI am happy to help with cooking, cleaning and any of the day to day chores.\n\nA full time position is what I seek most but I am open to part-time or occasional jobs. \n\nI'd love to get the opportunity to get to meet your family & would be happy to provide references upon request.
