I excel at multitasking, building strong connections with both children and families, and creating a nurturing atmosphere. Certified in CPR and First Aid, I have specialized training in potty training, walking/crawling classes, and toddler development (Big Little Feelings). I am also experienced in introducing solid foods to infants as young as 6 months and supporting early developmental milestones like walking and crawling.

I'm creative, friendly, and approachable, and I follow the parents' lead when it comes to enforcing household rules and communicating about their child's day.\n\nI'm comfortable caring for up to four children, ages 0 to 11. I enjoy playing a variety of games with children, including outdoor sports, board games, and educational games. I'm also willing to help with cooking, meal preparation, carpooling, and light housekeeping. I'm First Aid trained, and I have taken coursework in early childhood development.\n\nI'm passionate about supporting families and providing a reliable childcare option for them.

As a babysitter, the oldest child and as the mother of a 23-year-old. I have a lot of experience working mainly with toddlers and adolescents but have experience caring for infants as well. I truly love children and I approach each child as an individual I get to help grow and teach.\n\nPrior to taking on babysitting full time I worked as a home health aid for the elderly for 10 years. During this time I gained experience helping people with different special needs and also took the proper training and certification courses.\n\nI am happy to help with cooking, cleaning and any of the day to day chores.\n\nA full time position is what I seek most but I am open to part-time or occasional jobs. \n\nI'd love to get the opportunity to get to meet your family & would be happy to provide references upon request.
