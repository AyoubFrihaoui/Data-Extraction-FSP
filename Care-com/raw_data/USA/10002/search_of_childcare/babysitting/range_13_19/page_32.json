I have extensive experience with kids of all ages and personality types. I am never thrown for a loop and can handle any situation. Not only have I had several steady babysitting jobs since I was 13--I am like a deeply trusted member of the family--but I have been a camp counselor in Manhattan and started my own non-profit tutoring program when I was in 7th grade, which is still going strong (REACH NYC tutors). I love working with kids and hope to dedicate my life to helping children. I am energetic and creative, and I can engage several children at a time with arts & crafts, games, sports and music. I'm orderly and responsible--and I know how to get kids to do what they need to do--and have fun doing it. I am First Aid, CPR and lifeguard certified.",

I volunteered at my church's daycare all of middle school and high school. I taught dance my last two years of high school and first year of college to young students from ages 3-16. Before transferring to NYU, I was a full time dance instructor and after school teacher at an elementary school back home, I miss them dearly and would love to return that love and care to families that need help out here! I have had experience with childcare, transportation, tutoring, special needs, teaching, and being an excellent role model.

Many skills were developed working for 30years, which I learn the nature of feeding a child with patience and preparation. The ability to observe their safety, behavior, and personality. Lastly the gentleness of communication to grow together with all children I've cared for. My intentions in life is to see children grow up respecting themselves and others and building the foundation best for their future. I'd describe my personality as gentle, observant, and loving. I'm looking for a job that is a safe and respectful environment. I started working with kids when I was 18years old, working in a nursery. One thing you should know about me is I give respect because I would like it in return. My skills include bathing, feeding, and communicating.",
