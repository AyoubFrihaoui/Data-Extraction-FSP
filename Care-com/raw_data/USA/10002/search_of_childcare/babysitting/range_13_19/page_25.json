I'm motivated by a desire to make a positive impact on children's lives. I consider myself to be patient, calm, creative, and persistent. I believe in providing a safe space for children to grow and learn.\n\nI communicate regularly with parents about their child's day. I can provide verbal updates at pickup, or send regular updates via text or phone call. I'm also very comfortable enforcing household rules.\n\nSome of the games I enjoy playing with children include outdoor sports and physical games, board games and puzzles, and educational games that promote learning. I'm willing to help with cooking and meal preparation, light housekeeping, travel, and supervising swimming.\n\nI have completed coursework in early child development, as well as First Aid training and CPR training. I am currently working to receive my certification in early childhood education.",

I worked at the Boys and Girls club, various after-school programs, and an LGBTQ homeless youth shelter. I have worked as a facilitator for a support group with transgender children at the Philadelphia Children's Hospital. I started babysitting and becoming a nanny for younger children in 2012. I have been a nanny for an infant starting at 2. 5 months old. Prior to that, I was a full-time caretaker to a 6-year-old autistic trans girl for a year. I am currently looking for a stable gig with a minimum of 4 hours a day and at least $18 an hour.\nPreferably full time but I am available for part-time and one-time gigs. I live in the Kensington neighborhood in Brooklyn.\nAlso, I have years of being a cat sitter and am open to dog sitting. I love house plants and taking care of them as well.",

My name is Michelle and I have been caring for children around me for the past 6 years in terms of siblings and family members, or children of family friends, & 1 year of formal babysitting experience where I was paid. But for those 6 years, I watched after children without wanting anything in return, except the satisfaction of being a trustworthy and positive role model and influence for the youth around me. I am an older sister and have many younger cousins around me. Caring after children have always been a part of my life, so being maternal, helping around the house, and putting the safety of a child at the forefront of everything is something that is more so ingrained into who I am. Children are innocent and gravitate toward trustworthy people who will protect and care for them as if they are their own. This is who I am. As of right now, I'm a junior student at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, pursuing a bachelor's degree in Law & Society and Political Science.",
