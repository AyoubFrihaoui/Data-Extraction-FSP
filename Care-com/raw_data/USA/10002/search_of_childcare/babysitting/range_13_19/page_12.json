I'm a massive proponent for arts & crafts and coloring, and I actually massively enjoy joining in alongside the kids I babysit. \n\nI volunteered in Brooklyn throughout my teens, helping under grade-level kids learn to enjoy and excel at reading. I aim to implement that into my babysitting as well. I'll never forget how excited I was to show a parent who had told me that their son (5 years old), who had been refusing to learn to read or write, had painted a picture of a goat on a mountain in which I helped him label.\n\nFinally, it doesn't hurt that I make a banging Bolognese and am excellent at doing dishes.",

I have two young sisters, currently aged 6 and 10, whom I love and have had the pleasure to full-time nanny over many summers and winters. I have experience with infants, as well as pre-teens. I have worked with kids with special needs and am very attentive. Having graduated with a degree in musical theater, I am very active, bubbly, and happy, yet loving, compassionate, and kind.\n\nI am looking for babysitting or full-time nannying positions. \n\nI do not have a car in the city, but I am able to transport myself to work.",
