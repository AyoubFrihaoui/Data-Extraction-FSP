I've been looking after children since I was 9. I was always the babysitter, always the one you'd call if you needed any help. I've just always loved kids. I told my parents they needed to give me a sibling just so I would have someone to look after!

As a caregiver, my passion lies in nurturing the growth and development of children. With two years of experience caring for young ones, I strive to create a safe, nurturing, and stimulating environment where they can thrive. I believe in children's creativity and imagination while instilling a love for learning through engaging activities.\n\nMy patient and calm demeanor allows me to handle any situation with composure and understanding. I maintain open communication with parents, providing regular updates and addressing any concerns promptly. With my friendly and approachable nature, I easily build strong relationships with both children and their families. \n\nI'm comfortable following the household rules set by the parents and am happy to help with cooking, meal preparation, and light housekeeping. My First Aid Training ensures that I can respond effectively to any medical emergencies.",
