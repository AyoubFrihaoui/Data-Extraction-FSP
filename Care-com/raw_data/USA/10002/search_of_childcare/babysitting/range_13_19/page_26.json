I've learned how to keep kids entertained with games, crafts, and outdoor activities. \n\nIn addition to babysitting, I worked at a daycare for a couple of years, where I helped with everything from storytime to snack time. It was a great way to gain more experience and learn how to manage different age groups. I really enjoyed building relationships with the kids and seeing them grow! \n\nI've also volunteered at community events for kids, which was super fun. Overall, it's been such a rewarding experience!",

With four years of experience as a caregiver I'm excited to bring my enthusiasm and skills to your family! \n\nI love to connect with children at their level. I'm creative, imaginative, and always up for a game of tag or a dance party. I believe in creating a safe and supportive environment where children can learn, explore, and just be kids.\n\nAs a caregiver, I understand the importance of open and honest communication with parents. I'll keep you updated on your child's day, whether it's through regular text messages, phone calls, or verbal communication during pickup. \n\nWhen it comes to enforcing rules, I believe in following the parents' lead. My role is to support your parenting style and ensure that your child feels loved, respected, and safe.\n\nI enjoy a wide range of activities with children, from outdoor games to art time to whatever it is that makes your child light up!",

She has learned and grown alot! Prior to that she was hired to help my wife get the boys prepared and ready for school while my wife was pregnant, since then she has been one of my wife's most helpful sitters, staying mornings with our little girl, taking on date night shifts with all 3 (our two rowdy boys included). She is wonderful and we highly recommend her. We will continue to use her as well for weekend shifts and date nights as all 3 of our children are now attending school/ daycare. We Highly recommend her ♥️",
