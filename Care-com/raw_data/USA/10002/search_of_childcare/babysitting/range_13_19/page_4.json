As a college student in school to be a pediatrician, I have ample experience as both a caregiver, and medical professional. I currently work as a Behavior Technician with children with Autism to help them learn behavioral skills and navigate the world. In addition to my RBT license, I am certified as an EKG technician, a CNA, and am currently completing my Child Development Associate credential. Indubitably, medical school is a very long journey, and as I complete that, different roles in both child and senior care have become both a hobby and passion of mine outside of the classroom. I have experience in a plethora of settings including in home childcare, classroom setting, daycares, summer camps, and nursing homes. I am extremely caring, understanding, and reliable, am fully vaccinated, and CPR trained for infants, children, and adults! Can also provide my professional resume upon request :)",
