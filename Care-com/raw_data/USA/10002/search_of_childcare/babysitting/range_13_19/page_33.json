I'm looking for a position with a family that offers clear job expectations and a strong, mutual connection so that the family and I can communicate effectively and work together harmoniously. I've been working with kids since 15 years old. I started as a daycare assistant for a summer youth program. In my spare time, I enjoy reading, spending time with my family, trying out new activities with my nieces and nephew.

I have 5 years babysitting/nanny experience and also have been teaching dance to kids for the past 7 years! I have babysat children as young as 6 months old and taught dance to as young as 2! I am comfortable taking care of infants as well. Activities such as crafts, board games, reading stories, and making up dances are some of my favorite to do with kids. I can drive, but I don't own my own car. I am CPR certified and can perform basic first aid. Safety is among one of my top priorities in taking care of children! I would love to care for some awesome kids, as it is one of my passions, while also earning a bit of extra money to relieve some of the financial burdens of being a young adult in the city! WORKING ON BACKGROUND CHECK, just expensive and saving up for it.",
