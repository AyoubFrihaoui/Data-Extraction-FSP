Most recently I worked as a pediatric dental assistant for 4 years post grad. A few months ago I transitioned into work in child welfare. The people who have worked around me or who know me well, would not hesitate to recommend. They would say that I have a deep care and intentionality with children that a lot of people don't and that I am good at knowing when to be fun and when to be stern. Most of all I do just enjoy working with children because I get to be my silliest self and have fun.",

I also work creatively in photography- and plan to minor in fashion photography. I live near the village!\n\nI have been babysitting since I was a baby -- and I have experience with young kids and infants -- I also worked as a lifeguard in high school and taught swimming classes for toddlers. \n\nAdditionally, I am CPR and AED trained! \n\nExpect darling photos of your kids and/or pets when they're with me! I am a lover of wearable arts, I can sew and knit -- I find a lot of joy in making little gifts and clothes for people to wear. \n\nI am open and very communicative, I want to get to know the families I care for. It means a lot that your kid will know and trust me - to be able to have fun and grow. Being apart of that process means everything. It is the joy of child care \nAlso my music taste is impeccable so your kid will definitely develop a tasteful palette around me",

I previously lived with my sister to help care for her now 1-year-old son, and I also frequently babysit my other nieces (ages 1. 5 and 2. 5) for weeks at a time. In 2020/21 I nannied and homeschooled for a pair of 6-year-old twins, one with ADHD, until they returned to school. I then provided transportation, after-school care, schedule building help, housekeeping and general personal assistance for their mother, all of which I still am able to provide for any family. With my skills, experience and love for child-care/teaching, I am confident that I can provide a fun and safe environment for your kids to grow!",
