I have loved working with kids from a young age (going on 6 years of babysitting experience now), and have ample experience with children ranging from 1-year-old all the way through high schoolers. I have one younger brother and two baby sisters, and I have babysat them, driven them different places, and acted simultaneously as a motherly and sibling role model to them. If needed, I can assist in homework help for kids in school, and I can also play along with whatever activity your child wants to do. Due to my experience, I have an easy time connecting with, empathizing with, and communicating with children of all ages, and I would love the opportunity to provide you with a safe way to give both you and your kids a quality time! I'm very flexible schedule-wise and rate-wise, and am more than willing work with your needs. If needed, I can provide references, and I hope to get in touch!",

I graduated from the University of Colorado Boulder in 2023 and received my BA in Psychology with minors in WGST and Education. I am passionate about working with children and have 8+ years of experience babysitting. I also was an overnight camp counselor for 2 summers as well as a swim instructor for classes ranging from mommy and me with children as young as a couple months up to 12 years old! In my two previous jobs I was a Mental Health Counselor on an adolescent psychiatric inpatient unit and before that I worked as a supervised visitation monitor for non-custodial parents and their children. I am outgoing, creative, and love spending time working with children. I am available for week days as well as weekends and try by best to be flexible! I also love pets and animals!",
