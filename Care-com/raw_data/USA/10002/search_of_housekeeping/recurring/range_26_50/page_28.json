I grew up cleaning--it comes natural. While many people will wonder why on earth I'm offering these services given that I have a PhD in criminal justice, the answer is simple: I am in need of additional income. Since August 2021, I've been single-handedly financing a child custody case. My sister tragically died in August 2021 and her ex who never had physical custody just took off with my niece, who I helped raise. I have been fighting hard to get her back. I am employed and work primarily from home (I teach online), so I have the flexibility that's needed to be a housekeeper. Honestly, I find manual labor like cleaning to be therapeutic, and since I have the experience (e. g., I cleaned homes throughout college and even assisted my mother with some of her jobs well into last year), I think it is ideal for me.",

I am also someone who is naturally tidy and organized, which I feel is a huge benefit to being a solid Housekeeper. I am also a good cook and got a degree in Culinary Arts.
