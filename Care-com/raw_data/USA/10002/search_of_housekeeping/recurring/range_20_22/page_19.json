If you'd like to get an idea of my personality, I was the friend in high school who would clean friends' rooms, desks, even kitchen pantries to make their lives easier But it would be my pleasure to tackle that space you've been putting off organizing, give you breathing room in the room you're never sure where to start in, or just give your home the refresher it needs. Simple tasks are welcome, too! Looking forward to working with you!!",
