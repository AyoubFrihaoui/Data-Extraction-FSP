I know how it feels to have an extra hand when it comes to housekeeping as I have lived by myself. We all struggle with time and trying to get everything done before the end of the day, so I am happy to be here as an extra help! \n\nIf you like to come back home and find your house ready for you and your family, vacuumed, organized and clean, look no further! Use your time to spend with your family or to relax after a long day, and I will take care of your house.\n\nI consider myself very flexible and willing to help at most of the duties. I could clean in general, clean and organize fridges and pantries, laundry( I am really good at removing stains and big believer clothes need to be washes with like colors), basements, closets and so on.",
