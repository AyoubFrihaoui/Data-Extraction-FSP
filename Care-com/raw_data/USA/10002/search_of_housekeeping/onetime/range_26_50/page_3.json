In both cities, most of my clients were referrals because I did an amazing job, and my clients adored me. I am smiley, friendly, and completely trustworthy. I've cleaned everything from small apartments to large houses, and there's nothing I can't clean. Plus I've reorganized closets, kitchens and defrosted refrigerators. I also cooked professionally for 9 years, and passed a Sous Chef test. I can do menu planning & grocery shopping, any kind of errand, laundry & ironing, party preps, and I'm terrific with pets. I'm an incredibly customer service oriented person, and I take a lot of pride in my work. In all honesty, you don't need to worry about a thing. I'd be happy to send you my resume.",
