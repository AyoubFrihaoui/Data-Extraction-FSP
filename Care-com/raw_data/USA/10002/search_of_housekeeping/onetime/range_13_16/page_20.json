Akiko has such incredible energy, she keeps our very active kiddos having so much fun. I don't trust many people but Akiko has such great experience and instincts that I'm never worried with her. We speak both English and Spanish at home and Akiko helps to encourage and teach during playtime. Plus she's somehow always finding ways to fit in extra cleaning, she never wastes a minute. Or she's come by just to help cleaning when that was needed. The kids just love her and my son asks when he gets to play with her again. Really I can't say enough beautiful things about Akiko, she's helped me in so many ways and I'm so thankful for all she does!",
                  "originalText": "Akiko is simply amazing! We hired her to help with our 1yo son, then a pause when we had our daughter and Covid, then again with 1yo daughter and 3yo son. Akiko has such incredible energy, she keeps our very active kiddos having so much fun. I don't trust many people but Akiko has such great experience and instincts that I'm never worried with her. We speak both English and Spanish at home and Akiko helps to encourage and teach during playtime. Plus she's somehow always finding ways to fit in extra cleaning, she never wastes a minute.
