I have always had a passion for caring for children, teaching and mentoring. I have been blessed with a variety of opportunities to teach elementary level students as well as high school, and college students. In the past I've served as a baby sitter for a variety of age groups, and have always been surrounded with children from my community, and in my family. I have worked with the I Have A Dream Foundation and taught English, Science, and Math to 3rd graders by planning and facilitating lesson plans. With all of these experiences I've truly learned the value of affirmations, patience, and how to successfully work with children. Caring for children is a really rewarding job, and it's so important in regard to helping them develop. I love it! I find a lot of joy in work of this nature, and I'm thrilled to offer my services!",
