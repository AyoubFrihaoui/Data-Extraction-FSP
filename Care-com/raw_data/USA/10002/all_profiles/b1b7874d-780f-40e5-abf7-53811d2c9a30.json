After spending a year in Germany as a Congress-Bundestag Scholar, I earned a Bachelor's degree in German at the University of Houston. In 2005, I moved to New York and spent over a decade working as an analyst in the magazine industry. Connecting with children has always come naturally to me. At 15, I had my first babysitting job, looking after three children - two boys, 6 and 5, and a girl, 6 months. Since then, I have cared for children of all ages as well as tutored a few subjects and taught German part-time at a private school. My last extended experience was helping a dear friend with her newborn and toddler after a C-section. With patience, compassion, and a good sense of humor, this meaningful work is fulfilling. I like games, especially backgammon and word games, as well as concerts, museums, films, and sports. My hope is to create impactful bonds with future clients.",
