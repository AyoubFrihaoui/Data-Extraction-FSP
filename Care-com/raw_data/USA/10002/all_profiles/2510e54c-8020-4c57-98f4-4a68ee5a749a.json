It was the best experience ever for 5 years because I watched them grow up like I watched my youngest sister. \r\n\r\nI have raised my sister since I was 13, so I really have experience with all different ages of babies, children, and teenagers. I even took care of my old grandma because she was living with me. \r\n\r\nand I was babysitting my neighbor's child. They had a child with Down syndrome and sleeping problems. \r\nThey would leave him with me when they went out. I really loved him and had so much fun with him because he had so much energy all the time. \r\n\r\nI love making kids feel safe and enjoy their time. \r\n\r\nWith much gratitude, Rawan.",
