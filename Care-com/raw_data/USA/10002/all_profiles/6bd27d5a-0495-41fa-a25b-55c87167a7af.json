I have 9 yrs of personal experience and 7 of care giver experience with children with special needs. I am ready and available to pick up/drop off your little ones to and from all activities. I am a firm believer that the arts help stimulate very important parts of your brain and are vital in daily life. I try to use them to brighten up a day whether that be playing a game related to the arts, seeing a live show of some sort, or even just playing it in the background around the house. I try to shoot for a well rounded day full of work and play. I am good with cooking for many allergies/dietary needs. I am currently a Substitute Teacher with Williamson County Schools. I was a teacher's aid for 6 years prior. My favorite subject is science but I am more than ready to assist with any subject on homework or tutoring. I am a huge animal lover. So, taking care of the fur-babies too is my pleasure!",

I worked at a VCA animal hospital so I spent my days caring for and playing with fur babies and making sure they stayed healthy and safe. I also work with a pet rescue as well. I have cared for dogs young and old and big and small. I have provided over night care, the occasional drop in for walks or feedings, and boarding. I have experience in caring for sick and/or senior animals and in giving medications. I have experience in bathing/grooming dogs as well! I am willing to house your pup overnight with me or stay overnight at your place. I don't have a fenced in yard but I do have a pretty big yard with a ton of room and am very close to 2 huge dog parks! I am good with special diets and food prep for those dogs who have sensitive stomachs. I have experience assisting a groomer so I can also give baths and do light grooming if wanted!",

I have worked one on one with students as well being in charge of whole classrooms of 20+ students. I worked as a teacher's aid and substitute teacher. I worked with Williamson County Schools and am familiar with their common core. I have taught numerous performing arts classes and camps. I have spent years teaching and heading up children's church programs. I have worked with individuals with special needs as well. I have experience in preschool through middle school tutoring and into high school/college for the arts. Academically, I graduated high school top of my class with a 4. 65 GPA and numerous other academic honors. I was a member of the BETA club, international honors society, international thespians society, and national honors society. I went on to be on the dean's list in college at Belmont University as a Musical Theatre major.",
