My clients were twin 4-year-old boys, and my main duties were to help them learn to read and write, so that was definitely a lot of experience both in teaching and with dealing with young twins. Once I turned 13, I had a regular babysitting job with a family until I graduated from high school. On occasion, I also sat for a variety of other families, including a family that had not only an infant but also twin 2-year-old boys. I definitely have a lot of experience dealing with rambunctious young boys (even twins!). I have dealt with everything from diapers to cooking, to fire alarms, fevers, and sick dogs. Once I turned 16, I often helped the families by driving their children to lessons and practices, and I still have my own car.",

            "experienceSummary": "I have been tutoring since I started college four years ago. I also had some experience tutoring in high school, but not on as large scale. I began tutoring with two students, an 8th grader in Biology and Geometry and a 6th grader in English and Math. I feel comfortable tutoring anything in middle school and below, and most subjects at the high school level. I got a very good GPA in high school and went to college with many AP credits. The bulk of my tutoring experience has been in SAT preparation. I have tutored 6 different high schooler's for their SAT's with marked improvements in their scores. I myself received a 2260 on my SAT's, with a perfect 800 verbal score on Reading and near perfect 750 on Math, making my score a 1550/1600 on the scale without the writing section that most competitive colleges use. I have developed a system that allows me to zero in on what a student struggles with in the SAT's to help them. I am a recent college graduate from the University of Maryland (May 2014), where I received a double degree in Computer Science and Communication. In my spare time, I ride horses and play volleyball. \n\nMy most recent SAT tutoring client was able to raise his score over 200 points to achieve a 2320 on his SATs with a perfect score in math and a 790 in reading.",
