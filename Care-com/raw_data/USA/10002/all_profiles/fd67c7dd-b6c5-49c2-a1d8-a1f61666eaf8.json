            "experienceSummary": "Hello! My name is Ashley. I am a nationally recognized Speech-Language Pathologist and I am actively seeking employment as a part-to full-time nanny or caregiver. I have over 10 years of experience working with children, adolescents and adults. I was raised in Connecticut before moving to Florida where I earned my Bachelor's and Master's Degrees in Speech Language Pathology at the University of South Florida. I relocated to the Upper East Side of Manhattan in June of 2013. I currently hold a New York State Teaching Certificate as well as New York State Professional license in Speech Pathology. I was previously employed as the speech pathologist at two elementary schools, a middle school and high school in Tampa, Florida, a center-based school in Brandon, Florida, and currently a sensory gym in Manhattan. I moonlight on weekends as a caregiver for a 30-year-old male diagnosed with High-Functioning Autism. I have worked (continue to babysit for...), as nanny for several families in Manhattan and I have references available upon request. Additionally, I have been fingerprinted and cleared by the Department of Education, Department of Health, and Early Intervention Program; I also have liability and malpractice insurance, health insurance, and I am a CPR certified. I am a nonsmoker, love pets and have many animals, most importantly have a wonderful family and boyfriend. If you have any additional questions, or would like to schedule a time to meet, please do not hesitate to contact me on my cell phone. Thank you for your consideration. Best, Ashley",
