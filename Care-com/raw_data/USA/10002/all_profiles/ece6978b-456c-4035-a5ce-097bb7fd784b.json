I have a background in education having worked as a teacher for international college students for many years. I am also a mother of a son who was born here, and grew up here, having also graduated from one of the Specialized High Schools. I am a professional nanny with over 17years of experience working with multiple children, ranging from infants to adolescents, both at nurseries and private homes, and children along the Autism spectrum as well. I like to see how children grow up and understand the world, I teach them to share and to be kind. With the consent of families I can go to  museums , shows, the Zoo, and the Garden. Some of the families I have worked with still invite me to their parties, and their children still remember and embrace me. That is the best feeling, the part that really touches my heart.
