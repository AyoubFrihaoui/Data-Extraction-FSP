I started as a home health aid and then worked as a certified nurse's aide in nursing homes. I currently work in the field as a private caregiver. I am honest and trustworthy. I have worked with numerous families on all shifts: hourly and on weekends; I've had the pleasure of accompanying them to and from their doctors' appointments and shopping; I am a very patient, caring, and understanding individual. I have extensive experience working with patients who have developed Dementia, Alzheimer, Stroke, and Lou Gehrig's disease, to name a few of some of the duties I was responsible for including but were not limited to daily direction, hands-on care, medication reminder, cooking, cleaning, errands, and household management, with lots of love and patience. \nI am also experienced in event planning. \nI look forward to bringing the same care to your family.",
