Caring is a universal act of kindness and being human so whether if I take care of babies or toddlers to seniors, we should treat everybody the same. I love to help older people as my way of paying back for the years I have missed taking care of my own. I love talking to them and have the patience to understand them when they are confuse. I would want to give them the care that I want to receive for myself. I am hard worker, god fearing, respectful and responsible. \nI'd describe my personality as jolly, helpful and patient.\nI'm looking for a job that I will feel safe and the senior would feel safe as well. I'm flexible with schedules and I expect flexibility with the family as well. In my spare time, I like to tidy up my surrounding\nOne thing you should know about me is I'm very understanding and patient and will do the job with integrity",
