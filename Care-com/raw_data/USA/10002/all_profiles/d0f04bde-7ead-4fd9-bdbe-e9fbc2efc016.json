After coming to NYC in 1993, I first started working as a nanny and house manager, nurturing children from newborn to preteen, and later, becoming a tutor to toddlers (2+) preparing them for kindergarten interviews, focusing on speech development, body awareness, independent thinking, etc., tailored to each child's needs. For two summers, I taught 3 classes to groups of kids aged 5-15: nutrition, movement and a hybrid art/global folklore class of my own design.\nI have had experience as a location manager when a family rented out their duplex for TV and photo shoots, ensuring the safety and cleanliness of the domicile.\nI would love to form a long-term partnership with a like-minded family. I am flexible, professional, punctual and organized. Fundamentally, I'm committed to giving the children I teach or care for my best.",
