I have experience working for moving companies, cleaning companies. Working for small companies/jobs here and there has given me more insight and more of an opportunity to enhance my skills. I like to be the best at what I do. I am first generation born American, my parents are from Europe. They offered me whatever they could and I learned from them that you have to work hard for what you want in this life. I finished college, I couldn't find a job in the legal field as a Paralegal, so I started working bigger jobs in the cleaning/housekeeping field. I am the oldest of 5 kids in my family. I took care of my siblings, not only by cleaning and washing in the house, but also by cooking and preparing food, making sure that they did their homework, learned what was needed to be learned. My Dad had two jobs, one as a security guard in the city and the second as a superintendent in Brooklyn. I have exceeded my duties with pride.
