I have been babysitting/nannying either full time or part time since 2013. I worked as a full-time nanny during the pandemic as well. I keep in touch with all 15+ families (over 30 kids!) that I have worked for through the years!\n \nI have worked with every single age from newborn to 12 years old, including babies/kids with autism, speech delays, and genetic disorders. I have also helped families navigate through divorces, fertility issues, surrogacies and adoptions. I am happy to answer any questions you may have about my experience.\n\nI was born and raised in NYC and love it! This has definitely made me a \"city kid\" who can navigate the subway and bus system as well as the city with ease.",

Students who were facing the possibility of summer school were required to stay several hours after school. I worked with these students, teaching several different concepts in math (algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus) as well as developing skills and confidence for problem solving. I have gained most of my experience as a tutor while completing four years of college as an undergraduate student majoring in biochemistry. During this time, I tutored a student in the first grade who was struggling with reading. Through several sessions, her reading skills improved drastically and her reading level had doubled. I also tutored a student beginning in the second grade and continuing through the third and fourth grades. This student had difficulty understanding various concepts in math, but excelled in each grade. We worked through numerous problem sets, textbooks, and homework assign.",
