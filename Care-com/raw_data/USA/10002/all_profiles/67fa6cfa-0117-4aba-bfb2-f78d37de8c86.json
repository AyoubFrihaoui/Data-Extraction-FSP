I am currently employed as a software engineer and work remote from my home in the Tribeca area!\n\nThroughout highschool I babysat for a couple of families. I babysat a 2-year-old until she was around the age of 4, and her baby brother from just after he was born. I only stopped babysitting for this family when I moved to another state. I would babysit these children in their home or take them on excursions, like to the park or indoor jungle gym. I grew up in a family of 4 children and was the second oldest. My younger siblings are 5-8 years younger than me so I also always helped out watching over them as they grew up. I am comfortable babysitting a child of any age and my schedule is flexible!\n\nI also volunteer and teach children how to code so I would definitely be able to help your children with their homework should they need help",
