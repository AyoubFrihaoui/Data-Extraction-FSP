I thank God, and my husband for working so hard and giving me the opportunity of taking care of our children at home. That's the reason why I take so personal taking care of other people's children, because I think the way , specially mothers, feel when they have to leave their little ones because responsibilities call up. Besides my experience with special needs kids, including all kind of therapies: Speech, Occupational, Physical and ABA, I just love to be around kids and take care of them like they were mine. I used to have a part time job at a school as a Recess Aide, just loved it, the same way they loved me. I had the opportunity to teach first grade once graduated, it was the most beautiful experience, besides being a mom. Trusting me your kids would be easy once you see that I'm not only a clown. I can be a teacher, friend and a person who has a lot of love to give.",

That's why when it comes to my seniors, I understand every son/daughter needs on leaving their parents on hands of \"strangers\". But there are still good people who can love and care about your love ones, and I consider myself one of those. Before I became a mom, I used to volunteer at a home for seniors, reading, playing bingo with them, painting, telling jokes and making both happiest. I say both because they were so happy during the short time that I had available for them and my satisfaction was even bigger than theirs making them smile and feeling love and protected. That's exactly how I feel about kids too. Both love are magicals.",
