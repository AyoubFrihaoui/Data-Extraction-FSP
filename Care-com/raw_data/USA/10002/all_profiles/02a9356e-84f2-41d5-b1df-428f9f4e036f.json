I've been a nanny to a boy who was only a few months old to watching and helping a 9 yr old boy with challenges in his studies due to learning disabilities. I like to help around the house too as I know all too well what it is to come home after a long day at work and have homework with school age children and still have dinner and home maintenance to deal with. I am very good at working with preschool age children, in that I can help them become, not only, ready for school but successful when they enter. I have training in various methods of literacy and can be a great guide and motivator with a struggling reader. I have many diversified experiences and would be a blessing to your home in making both you and your child(ren)'s lives feel more relaxed and effortless. I always go the extra mile in order to help others, so you can look forward to coming home and finding your home tidy and your child happy and cared for so you can relax easily when you arrive home. I also have experience working with elder care. I have the wonderful privilege of caring for a 93 yr old woman daily who I was a companion to. I grew to love her. I managed her home and kept it tidy weekly, bathed her twice per week and made her meals. I also did her laundry once per week. I really enjoy helping others as it gives me a sense of real satisfaction knowing that I was able to make a difference in someone's life just by making their life a bit easier and making them smile.",
