At the start of covid I was a private homeschool teacher for a 9yr old girl Mon-Fri. Previously I was a full-time nanny to 8-year-old twins Mon-Fri, as well as a part-time tutor to a 9yr old on Saturday mornings. Most recently, I was a temporary nanny for a 5-month-old, a 2-month-old and an 8-month-old. I'm currently looking for weekend work for occasional date nights. I speak English and some Spanish and I also have a background in music and dance. I am CPR, First Aid, and AED certified. I'm also fully vaccinated & boosted.
