            "experienceSummary": "I am 44. I started babysitting when I was 10! I was a live-in nanny for an overnight nurse during high school (kids were 6 and 9) and I put myself through college by being a live-in nanny in CT for a family of three kids (ages 2, 5 and 6) for 14 months. For three summers, I did fill-in/temp nanny work in NYC from newborns to age 12 and then was a live-in nanny for a 10-month-old in NJ for a year. I moved to Denver and provided nanny services for 10-month-old twins and their 10-year-old brother. \n\nI am a responsible house sitter, savvy personal assistant, non-smoker who is incredible with a wide variety of people. I am very compassionate. I have volunteered with homeless families and have even brought in abused moms and children to live with me. I have been a single mom for eight years to a daughter that I literally thank God for. I try very hard not to judge people, and that said, I have a lot of friends who are gay. I would be just as comfortable working for a gay person, even someone HIV+ as I have volunteered with AIDS programs. \n\nI have a clean driving record (for 27 years) and valid license. I have a current passport and can pass any drug test at anytime. I enjoy running errands, doing laundry, reading, listening to all kinds of music and staying in touch with friends and family. I was a former lifeguard and swimming instructor and would enjoy helping with water therapy. I am very interested in a Monday through Friday job, but I will be available for some overnight/weekend/travel with the understanding that my daughter will be with me all the time when school is not in session. \n\nIdeally, I am looking for a long-term live OUT or live-in situation, either on the top or bottom floor of your place (thinking brownstone). My daughter is lovely, bright, well-mannered, intelligent, advanced reader and very outgoing. She loves pets and older grandparent-types. We want a situation that is a win-win for everyone. We have a lot of love to give! Also, please do not think by me having a daughter that I would not be a good fit for you. It only means, I am that much more responsible, loving and dependable. She has been going to work with me and we have great references! Thank you for considering me to help care for you or your parent.",
