They should not be forgotten about - they hold stories and history that are valuable. Through my late grandma and my nonni I've learned about the amazing insights they hold. I am open to simply listening, cooking, light housework, and medication management. If they are able to walk, I would absolutely love to do that with them as well. I am energetic and ready to go. I have experience with group therapy facilitation, multicultural research about the different generations, and have consistent face to face interaction within all my past jobs. Thank you!",
