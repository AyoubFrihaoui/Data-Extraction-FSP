I know how frustrating the search can be for leaving your loved ones in great hands, and I'm here to help with that. My passion for caring for and aiding people grew with me from since I was a young child. I was always aiding the elders of our community as well as babysitting for everyone instead of always playing with the other kids. It was one of the mom's most proud qualities of her 1st born. Most people I know, including everyone I've worked with, would say I'm responsible, respectful, dependable, caring, kind and a selfless person. All which makes me perfect for a job like this. I have my own transportation with a clean drink g record which makes pickups and running errands go smoothly. I look forward to hearing from you!",
