I bathe and dressed him to look nice all of the time. I a well connected with him and spend good moments talking about his past experiences. I have a way of convincing him to do things which sometime he refused to do, like doing a short walk (exercise, taking his meals on time and even taking his medicines on time. I always keep an eye on him and records my observations especially physical and behavioral changes. It is very important to have a good relationship with your client and his family.
