While I love these creative outlets, I have a genuine passion and fervor for taking care of people. I would love to be a companion and/or a caretaker to you or your loved one. Right now, my schedule is fairly random. I can commit to Saturdays and Sundays no problem- and I usually have 2 days open during the week, but would have to play it by ear. So looking for something flexible but long lasting! Would also be open to committing fully to Fridays as well if need be. Thanks so much for reading my spiel!",
