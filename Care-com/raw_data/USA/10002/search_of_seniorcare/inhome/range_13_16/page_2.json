I cared for both my parents extensively and it was done from my heart and is a strong and emotional memory. \r\n\r\nI started caring for seniors when my mother first got Alzheimer's. We lived one mile from my parents. And we turned our lives and schedules around to include my parents always.\r\n\r\nOne thing you should know about me is my parents taught me unconditional love above all. That loving conditionally isn't real love. \r\n\r\nWhen my parents aged they need my love more than ever. As my mother faded we had her for dinner a few nights a week. My daughter would put make up on her a number of times a week. And Sunday was always grandma and grandpa day \r\n\r\nMy skills include engaging in conversation that makes them feel important \r\n\r\nMaking sure they are safe when walking or transferring from one spot to the next.",
