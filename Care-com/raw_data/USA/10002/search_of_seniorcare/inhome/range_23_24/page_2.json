I love to help older people as my way of paying back for the years I have missed taking care of my own. I love talking to them and have the patience to understand them when they are confuse. I would want to give them the care that I want to receive for myself. I am hard worker, god fearing, respectful and responsible. \nI'd describe my personality as jolly, helpful and patient.\nI'm looking for a job that I will feel safe and the senior would feel safe as well. I'm flexible with schedules and I expect flexibility with the family as well.
