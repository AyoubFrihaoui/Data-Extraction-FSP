Caregiving is my true passion, allowing me to make a meaningful impact in the lives of those in need.\n\nI bring extensive experience supporting bedridden individuals and those using wheelchairs with essential daily activities, including feeding, bathing, mobility assistance, and companionship. Over the course of seven consecutive years, I devoted myself to the care of one individual, refining my skills in medication administration, as well as deepening my patience, empathy, and ability to manage time effectively.

As well as shopping and taking to appointments!\n\nI'm a passionate artist and filmmaker outside of the work I've done in care and with children with autism. What I can provide is someone who will make your special person laugh, get creative and feel like they have a friend who is there to listen! Needing help is hard, I know the desire to be independent is a hard thing to give up. I'm here to make that transition easy and feel fun.
