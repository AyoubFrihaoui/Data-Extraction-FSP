Caring is a universal act of kindness and being human so whether if I take care of babies or toddlers to seniors, we should treat everybody the same. I love to help older people as my way of paying back for the years I have missed taking care of my own. I love talking to them and have the patience to understand them when they are confuse. I would want to give them the care that I want to receive for myself. I am hard worker, god fearing, respectful and responsible. \nI'd describe my personality as jolly, helpful and patient.\nI'm looking for a job that I will feel safe and the senior would feel safe as well. I'm flexible with schedules and I expect flexibility with the family as well. In my spare time, I like to tidy up my surrounding\nOne thing you should know about me is I'm very understanding and patient and will do the job with integrity",

                    "experienceSummary": "Hi! My name is Karen, and I bring seven years of experience in senior care. Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of supporting individuals of all ages, including an extraordinary woman who lived to 110. Caregiving is my true passion, allowing me to make a meaningful impact in the lives of those in need.\n\nI bring extensive experience supporting bedridden individuals and those using wheelchairs with essential daily activities, including feeding, bathing, mobility assistance, and companionship. Over the course of seven consecutive years, I devoted myself to the care of one individual, refining my skills in medication administration, as well as deepening my patience, empathy, and ability to manage time effectively. My commitment to quality care ensures that I effectively meet the unique needs of each person I assist.\n\nI am also available for evening shifts and welcome the opportunity to bring my expertise and compassion to a new caregiving role.",
