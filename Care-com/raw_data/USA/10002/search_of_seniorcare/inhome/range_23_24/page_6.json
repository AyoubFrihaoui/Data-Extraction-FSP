I'm very passionate and understanding especially in this job field because taking care of someone's loved one is highly important to me as well as creating a safe environment for everyone. I engage, laugh, and care for all my clients. I'm really friendly. I have experience in overnight positions so if that's an option i'll be happy to go forward with that but I'm totally okay with the hours you provide. I'm understanding, flexible and reliable. I have a car where I don't mind traveling far distances. Being on time was never a problem for me. I have about 2 references as of right now and wouldn't mind sending them.
