I look forward to helping those who cannot do for themselves whether minimally or on the extensive side. Everyone needs help in some kind of way.\n\nI started caring for seniors two years ago. Although, I have previous experience by caring for my mother at a very young age which motivated me to continue my caregiver role and become a Certified Home Health Aide because it is something that I love doing. \n\nOne thing you should know about me is I am very patient and persistent. I focus on the task at hand and never behave inappropriately with their loved one. I have a job to do once I come through the door and my client is my main focus. \n\nMy skills include bathing and personal care, grocery shopping, accompanying patients to doctor's appointments.",
