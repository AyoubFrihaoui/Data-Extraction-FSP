I grew up helping with caregiving duties for my grandparents, so I have experience working with and caring for seniors with Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, diabetes, and stroke survivors. I helped to bathe, feed, clothe, and transport my grandparents, and since they've passed, I've been volunteering weekly as a companion to a senior neighbor. \n\nI have a passion for working with the age group and can't wait to get to know you and your family more!",
