I'm qualified as a nurse assistant, also this is where I've been able to touch the geriatric part of care giving. With all the different age groups I've worked with the one I enjoy the most happens to be toddlers. I enjoy working with them the most because they are always ready to learn they see the world with such innocent eyes and they also teach you the most. I'm a very upbeat and energetic young lady who loves kids and animals I love playing around and just going on adventures! I am also skilled in nursing , meal preparation, medication reminders, and even simple conversations. I've worked predominantly with geriatric patients with dementia.",
