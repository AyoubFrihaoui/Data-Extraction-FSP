I'm an artist with an MFA from Yale School of Art. \n\nMy skills include experience working with seniors with Alzheimers, Frontotemporal Dementia, and Aphasia.

I'm 41, loving, caring, compassionate, detail oriented, neat, dependable hardworking lady. I have active License of HHA, valid DL. I used to take care of a bed bound lady who was 90 years old on Hospice Care. She was the very first client I started working with as soon as I got my HHA license, 2021. She was in the early stage of dementia. And she was special and sweet..! Unfortunately, she passed. My next patient was 78 y. o. old lady who I took care of for about 8 months, she was very sweet and independent! Meanwhile, I had to work in another field of activity due to circumstances. I'm finally back to the Caregiver position and continue to move forward, share care and love with seniors! References will be provided by families. Willing to travel long distances.",
