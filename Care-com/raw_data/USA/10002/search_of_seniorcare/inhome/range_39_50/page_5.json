I used to work as a nurse and really enjoyed coming to my elderly patients every day and were doing my best to make their days better. I also volunteered in NYC hospitals and nursing homes. I love having conversations, listening to stories, reading books together. Being a companion to seniors is something that is easy and enjoyable for me truly.\n\nUpdate: I am now a licensed registered nurse and work at the nursing home/ hospice. \nMy shifts are primarily from 6 a.m.  to 2 p.m.  and I would be happy to pickup extra hours here and there when possible.

My residency program does not allow moonlighting, thus finances are a bit tight. I can work weekends during this three-week period and weekday nights. In all honesty, I'm trying to make as much money during this period, thus a good paying weekend live-in job will be preferred. Prior to residency, I worked for a couple of years as a caregiver ( mainly weekend live-in) in California (Newport Beach and Beverly Hills). I can provide references if needed and I can also prove I'm a physician. Now with that said, I do NOT have a NY State medical license. I only have a provisional medical license from the state I currently live and study. I will function as a caregiver, not a as a physician; I'll just be a caregiver that happens to be a physician. If something is off with medication or treatment, I can raise a concern, but that will be the extent.",
