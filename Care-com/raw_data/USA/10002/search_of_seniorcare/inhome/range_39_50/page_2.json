I love caring for seniors, listening to their stories, and learning from their wisdom. I'm seeking a role providing companionship and support, assisting with light chores, meal prep, medication management, errands, and daily movement.\n\nIn my 20s, I was a senior companion for a wonderful woman, Norma. One of my closest friends was in her 90s before she passed during the pandemic.
