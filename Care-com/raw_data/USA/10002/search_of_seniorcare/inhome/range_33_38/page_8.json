I used to work for the travel and hotel business in the Philippines. Also, I took courses on caregiver lessons and was conducting proper health care for elderly in our neighborhood on summer. I love interacting with elderly and enjoy their company immensely. I find the work very rewarding and thus, I am committed to provide a happy, positive, nurturing environment for my patient in my care. Working with an elderly, gives me the feeling of still having my parents and grandparents, since I'm the one who toke care of them.
