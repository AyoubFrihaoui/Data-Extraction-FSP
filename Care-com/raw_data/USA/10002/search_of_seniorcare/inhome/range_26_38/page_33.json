My physical strength enabled me to support her during our walks, ensuring she felt secure and confident wherever we went. I also cared for her two small dogs daily, highlighting my comfort and proficiency with pets. Running errands throughout the city was a regular part of my duties. Although I live in Weehawken, I love to work in the city and can easily commute. I am passionate about providing high-quality care and companionship, making every day enjoyable and stress-free for those I support.",
