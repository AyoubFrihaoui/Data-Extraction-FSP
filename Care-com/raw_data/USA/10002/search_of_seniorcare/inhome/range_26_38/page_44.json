She has been patient, reliable and helpful, willing to go the extra mile if needed. Some examples include staying late to complete a task (ie laundry) or simply helping put away groceries even if it wasn’t her day-to-day task. She’s often picking up the kids from school, and taking them to their after school activities, going to the park or simply being with them at home. One thing I’ve always appreciated, has been Eva’s communications skills. For example, she’s almost always early (if not, right on time), and if she’s running late, she lets me know.
