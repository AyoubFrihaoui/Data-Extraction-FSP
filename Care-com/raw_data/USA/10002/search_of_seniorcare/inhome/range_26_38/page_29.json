I relocated here early this year after both of my parents died, in the hopes of seeking a greener pasture and a new family to work with a family I can be a part of and I can consider I belong to. I used to work for the travel and hotel business in the Philippines. Also, I took courses on caregiver lessons and was conducting proper health care for elderly in our neighborhood on summer. I love interacting with elderly and enjoy their company immensely. I find the work very rewarding and thus, I am committed to provide a happy, positive, nurturing environment for my patient in my care. Working with an elderly, gives me the feeling of still having my parents and grandparents, since I'm the one who toke care of them. I have worked for two families part time - one in the city and one here in Long Island.",

Most of us will become senior and I would like to be helped by someone like me who is happy to help and hopefully make you feel comfortable.\n\nI'm looking for a job that needs me. I am a CNA and was a HHA . I took care of my mom who had Alzheimer's.\n\nI started caring for seniors on and off for over 20 years .\n\nIn my spare time, I like to go to the theater, swim and enjoy reading,\n\nOne thing you should know about me is I treat everyone with respect and compassion.\n\nMy skills include listening, caring and taking care of their needs.",
