Jonathan was knowledgeable about immediate medical needs to check if Dad needed to be in an urgent care situation. If it were not for our family's decision to relocate my Dad to a continuing care community out of state, we would still have had Jonathan continue to care for him. Jonathan was present up through the time we had to transition Dad to a new caregiver. Thank you, Jonathan, for your exceptional service as a caregiver.  ",

                    "experienceSummary": "I'm originally from the South but have spent the last 5 years in Ithaca as I pursued my undergrad degree at Cornell. I adore working with anyone who needs extra support or just a companion! I am very attentive, dependable, and quick and great at communication! You can reach out to me anytime, whether it's to ask a question or check up on your family. \n\nWhile I do not have professional experience with senior care, I have aided both of my grandmothers with things like companionship, taking care of physically demanding errands, cleaning, changing and dressing as well as administering medication. \n\nI have skills in writing, arts and crafts, theater, music, and science related activities. I also have a dog and a cat, so I am very comfortable with any pets in the home. \n\n\nI look forward to working with you and your family :)",

                  "originalText": "Laure has been a wonderful babysitter for our family, caring for our 4-year-old daughter 3-5 times a week. Her patience, attentiveness, and creativity have made a significant impact on our child's development and happiness.\n\nOne of the standout qualities of Laure is her ability to come up with activities tailored to our daughter's specific needs and interests. Whether it's bringing books for story time, paints for an afternoon of creativity, or DIY materials for fun projects, Laure always has something engaging and educational planned. Our daughter loves these activities, and they have greatly contributed to her growth.\n\nLaure is also highly attentive and works seamlessly with our child's schedule. She ensures that meals and bathroom routines are handled with care and consistency, which is incredibly important for our busy household. She takes the time to understand our daughter's personality and needs, ensuring she feels comfortable and cared for.\n\nIn addition to our 4-year-old, Laure has occasionally looked after our youngest child, who was 4 months old at the time. Her experience with children of varying ages and personalities is evident in how she adapts her approach to meet their individual needs. She understands the importance of getting to know each child and creating a nurturing environment for them.\n\nLaure has been taking our daughter to the library, Stewart and Cass Park, the science center, and more providing her with a well-rounded experience that combines learning and play. Her dedication to our child's well-being and development is truly commendable.\n\nOverall, Laure's professionalism, creativity, and genuine care for our children make her an exceptional babysitter. We highly recommend her to any family seeking a reliable and nurturing caregiver.\n\nThank you, Laure, for everything you do for our family!",
