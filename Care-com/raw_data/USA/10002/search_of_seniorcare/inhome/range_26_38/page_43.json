Her manner is soft-spoken but confident, which works very well for my mother who has advanced dementia.  She has extensive experience and is excellent in the manner she takes care of my mother's hygiene, dressing, transferring, food preparation, and feeding.  All of these things would already distinguish her from most caregivers.  But, it is her sincerity, kindness, and patience that she shows to my mother that is most wonderful.  Kadia understands the importance of engaging my mother in conversation, giving her a reassuring pat on the arm, or holding her hand.  Kadia provides everything that is needed to give my mother the best quality of life.  My mother's eyes light up when she sees Kadia and she has a lovely connection with her.  I also deeply appreciate that Kadia is an excellent and courteous communicator with me.  On the rare occasion when she has had to change her schedule, she has told me far in advance.  And, if I'm out running errands, she stays in touch with me by text and phone to let me know how my mother is doing.  I feel very fortunate to have met Kadia, am very grateful for the care that she provides to my mother, and highly recommend her as a caregiver.  ",

Otherwise, you should stay away from this job. I have been working as a caregiver for 3 years, the last 2 years with a wonderful family, with a lovely lady with dementia, however I'm moving from New Jersey to New York and need to find a part time job here as well. I consider my strengths to be sociable, balanced and also have the ability to work with patients patiently. As an epilogue, I would like to mention, that mutual respect and empathy are important in any kind of relationship. I wish you and your family members good health.\n\nThank you for your time",

I graduated in 2020 with a Bachelor's degree in Biology from New Jersey City University. My professional experience I have spent the past eight years working with individuals of all ages with mental disabilities. I find it deeply fulfilling to help those who might feel overlooked, ensuring they feel seen and valued. I am also adept at preparing basic meals with a twist and maintaining an organized and clean home environment. I am available to work Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 pm, with flexibility for negotiating dates and hours. Sundays are reserved for church and personal preparation for the upcoming week.\n\nThank you for considering me for your needs. I look forward to the opportunity to assist in your home and am confident that the household will be well cared for. \n\nBest regards",
