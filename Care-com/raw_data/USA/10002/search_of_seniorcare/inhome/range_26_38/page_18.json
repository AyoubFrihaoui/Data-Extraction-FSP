My duties include caring for your loved ones needs - Showering, dressing, meditation dispensing, monitoring clients condition and reporting same to Doctor. Escort clients to hospital and Doctors appointments. I am willing to do light housework/cooking/shopping if necessary. I am compassionate & a good listener. I encourage social activities. Sometimes the elderly can become intimidated by the aging process so it is important to note this as it may present as depression. The Physician & family need to know this. I also have physical therapy training so I can create a plan of exercise for the client so that they will be strong & also safe, which is of the utmost importance. Keeping their environment clutter free promotes good fall prevention measures \nI am available for work immediately. Feel free to message me if you have any further questions about my qualifications or your needs. Sincerely. Violet.",

I believe in forming long term connections with those I work with so I can further meet their needs in ways that make them feel comfortable and understood. \n\nI was born and raised in Connecticut, although I attended a culinary school in Boulder, Colorado. I've spent time as a professional pastry chef, before teaching preschool age, and then going on to nanny full time.
