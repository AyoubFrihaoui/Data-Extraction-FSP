Ana was attentive, and detail-oriented, always watching for what my mother's needs were, and quick to take care of those needs, sometimes even before my\r\nmother knew she had them. Ana was consistent and complete in her reporting of what occurred on\r\neach shift, which I appreciated. She was also completely trustworthy, prompt, mature beyond her years,\r\nand always willing to cover for other caregivers. Ana's warmth and compassion for my mother, especially at the end of her life, is something I will never\r\nforget. I highly recommend Ana to any family.",
