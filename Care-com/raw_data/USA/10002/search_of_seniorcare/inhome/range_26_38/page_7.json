I enjoy working with seniors because they have so much to teach me. I think patience and compassion are very essential for being a care giver. It is a job that requires a lot of tolerance for challenging situations, great communication, and a positive attitude, which I acquire. \n\n\nIn the past 2 years while working with seniors I did many things such as errands, shopping, driving them around, light housekeeping, feeding them, preparing meals, bathing and dressing them, mobility assistance, medication prompting, and kept them physically active when needed. I've worked with seniors who had arthritis, dementia, Alzheimer's, strokes, and diabetes so I am very familiar to those illnesses. I catch on fast and I'm very open to learning new things.",
