Elderly people who are in isolation typically struggle emotionally and physically. I've seen first hand when I used to visit close relatives and friend's family members. Having social interaction like reading, conversations, listening to music, playing games, and other activities familiar to who I'm caring for provides for social and sensory stimulation. \nMy mission to make day-to-day life easier, happier, more comfortable, and safer for the person I'm a caregiver for and giving your family peace of mind.\n*Please see my biography from my childcare profile* Resume upon request",
