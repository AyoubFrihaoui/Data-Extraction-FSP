She was always providing our daughter with interesting educational experiences, and never did screen time with our daughter or spent time on her phone. We trusted her to fly with our daughter to our parent's homes, to spend the weekend with our daughter, and we even allowed our daughter to do a sleepover at Melinda's home. She is completely trustworthy--we provided her with a credit card and she was careful to keep receipts for all expenses. Even after she stopped being our nanny, we still asked that she care for our child on numerous occasions. She has even come to take our daughter out to dinner, unpaid!!! We paid a lot for a nanny matching service and you would be lucky to have her without the fee.",
