She helped her get through a rough patch in toilet training and was always finding engaging ways to keep our little one curious and active, including reading to our little one in Spanish and going on park adventures! \n\nShe was very flexible and communicative with us parents as well. Would definitely recommend Rachel to anyone looking for a reliable and experienced caregiver for their child. ",

She picked the girls up from school, fed them lunch, and played with them all afternoon. My favorite thing about Rachel is that she always comes to work with ideas for fun, interesting things to do with kids. Whether that's painting pictures, playing dress-up, starting a cooking project, or exploring a new park or museum. She was even a pro at mediating the typical 4yo disputes and tantrums when they came up. My daughter loves hanging out with Miss Rachel. Although we no longer need a nanny, she's still our top choice for a babysitter!",
