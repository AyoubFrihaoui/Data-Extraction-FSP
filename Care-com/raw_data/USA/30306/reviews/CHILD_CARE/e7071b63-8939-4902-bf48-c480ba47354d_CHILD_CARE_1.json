We only parted ways because our youngest started preschool (although she still helps out part-time). She is very responsible, great communicator, and SO LOVING with both of our boys and dog! Our 5 year old also has special needs, and her background / experience in ABA was very helpful for our family and how she approached care for our oldest son. Zayna became part of our family, and the next family that gets to work with her is so lucky!!",
