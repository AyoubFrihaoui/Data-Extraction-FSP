My kids loved  her and she understood very well the kind of care and attention they needed. She was so helpful to my partner in navigating around the city and finding fun things for the kids to do locally. The kids were so good with her we were comfortable enough to go on a date after work while we left her with the kids to handle their bedtime routine. \n\n",
