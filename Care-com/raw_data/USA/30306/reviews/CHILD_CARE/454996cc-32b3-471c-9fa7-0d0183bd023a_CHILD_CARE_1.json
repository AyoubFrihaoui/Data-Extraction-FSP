At the time my children were 3,4, and 8 which meant I needed not only someone who could help assist my 3 year old, who was use to a daycare environment, but my school aged children who needed help with class work. I still had to work so finding someone who was dependable with my work schedule and someone who was trustworthy with my children seemed impossible. Shadya was the 3rd person I had tried and I was feeling a little worried if she didn't work out. Thankfully she came in and was a perfect fit! She was able to balance my younger child, who I will say can be a handful, along with assisting my older two with their virtual classes and even helping them better understand work that they were struggling with. My kids adored her and felt super comfortable around her. If she was still here in the Savannah area I would still be using her till this day.",
