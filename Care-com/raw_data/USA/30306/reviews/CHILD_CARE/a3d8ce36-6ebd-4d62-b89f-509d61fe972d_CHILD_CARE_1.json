She started working for us when our children were 1 and 4 years old. She has always been punctual, reliable, thoughtful about our children's needs, consistent with meal planning, great with communication, and most importantly, loving to our children. As our children shifted into elementary school, Michelle started helping with other household tasks, errands, and cleaning. She also diligently supported our children with their homework and reading while balancing with play time and chores. We trust Michelle to keep our kids safe and to care for them as though they are her own. ",
