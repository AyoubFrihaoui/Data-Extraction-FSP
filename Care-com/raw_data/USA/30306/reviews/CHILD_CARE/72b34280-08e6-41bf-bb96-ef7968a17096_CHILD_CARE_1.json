Not only is she someone with decades of education and experience working with a wide spectrum of differently abled children, she is also a kind and incredibly loving human! She is responsible, thoughtful and conscientious. Our toddler has immediately loved spending time with her and I have always felt nothing but ease leaving the house when he is in her care! Thank you so much, Christy!!!",
