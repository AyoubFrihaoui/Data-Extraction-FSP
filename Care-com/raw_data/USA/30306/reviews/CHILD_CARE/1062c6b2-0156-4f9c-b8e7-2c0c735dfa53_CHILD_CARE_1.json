She takes direction exceptionally well; listens carefully to understand what you need, then does exactly that. \r\n\r\nShe has been gentle, caring, and patient with our baby, which were our priorities for a caregiver. She paid close attention to what she needed, learned how to keep her fed, well-rested, and happy, and helped us establish a solid routine.\r\n\r\nI would absolutely re-hire Maggie in the future and recommend her without hesitation!",
