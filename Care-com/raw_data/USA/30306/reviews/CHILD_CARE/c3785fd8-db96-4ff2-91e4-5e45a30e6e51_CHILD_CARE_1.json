She is so amazing with my special needs 11 year old, all while juggling care of the 3 younger ones (ages 3,7,9) like it's no problem at all.  Ashley is extremely detail-oriented and will follow your instructions to a tee, but also she makes the time fun for the kids, so they are always begging to have her back and miss her when it's been a while.  She is extremely punctual (actually, always the perfect amount of early to arrive!) unbelievably reliable, caring, and fun. Any parent's dream sitter.",
