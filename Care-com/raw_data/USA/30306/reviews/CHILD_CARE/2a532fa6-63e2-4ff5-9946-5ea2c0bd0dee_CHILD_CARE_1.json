            "originalText": "Kiana was our nanny from 2012 to 2018. Ultimately we ended up moving her into a household manager role as well. She was integral in getting our schedules organized, a feat with four children. Originally, when we onboarded her, we had 2 school age children with various sports and activities. We were surprised with twins and that is when Kiana really shined. She is quick to jump into action and we realized she was meeting needs before we knew they were there. That coupled with her pleasant and professional demeanor is what led to her promotion. Kiana is great with children of all ages, and we were sad to see her go but very proud of her. We still use many of the implementations Kiana brought to our household, and we take every opportunity to see her when our schedules overlap. In addition to bringing balance into our homes, Kiana has become a part of the family. ",
