            "displayText": "Danielle was our nanny for several months. She was great at planning exciting days and excursions for our children and I always knew our children were safe with her. She was on time to each shift, completed the responsibilities laid out in our contract and worked to act on any feedback immediately. She was thoughtful and had our girls work on projects and presents to give to my husband and myself on Father's Day and my birthday which was sweet and touching. Sadly our nanny arrangement didn't work out as the \"fit\" just wasn't there with her and my children, but I would recommend her as a nanny. She was hard working, punctual, and took feedback well. Unfortunately sometimes the kids personalities just don't mesh and we just needed to find a better fit. However she is a great, dependable childcare provider and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend her to others.",
