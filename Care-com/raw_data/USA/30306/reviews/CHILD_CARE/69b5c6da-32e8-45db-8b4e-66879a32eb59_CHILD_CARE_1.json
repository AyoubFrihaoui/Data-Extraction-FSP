Grace is in my top 3 of people I trust with my kids. (Me, my mom, Grace) my two year old absolutely loves her. She is always punctual. She is extremely dependable and she treats my kids with compassion and respect. My kids are always kept on their routines and in bed on time. You can tell when she is with the kids that she is totally comfortable and confident in what she is doing. I feel lucky to have her a part of my network for help. I would recommend her 100%.",
