We hired her as a nanny for our 4 mo daughter and she was with us for about a year, until our little one started daycare. We would do it again without hesitation. Our daughter (and our cat) loved her and we trusted Pamela completely with her care. Pamela is highly experienced in caring for children and we on many occasions relied on her no-nonsense, practical advice. This was truly helpful to us as first-time parents since it is easy to get lost in an infinite sea of baby-related information and products. Pamela has over time performed many thoughtful acts of kindness (e.g., sharing her delicious cooking and small gifts with our daughter) and remains a dear friend of the family. We highly recommend her to your family.",
