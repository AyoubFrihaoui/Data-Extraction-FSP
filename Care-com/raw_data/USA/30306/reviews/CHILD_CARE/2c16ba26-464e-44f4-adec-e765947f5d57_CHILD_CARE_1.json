I attribute my kids's respectful and responsible behavior to her caring and engagement with them. She started taking care of my daughter when she was 2 years old. She was a difficult eater and needed a lot of attention that was difficult for me as I was pregnant the second time. We thank God for sending her to us. My daughter started eating well and loved Soranyi. Soranyi also started taking care of my son right from birth. He loved her too. You can trust her with your children. She always finds things to do with them and engages children very well. You will not find anyone as good as her fo sure. We had to let her go as my children did not need a nanny anymore but she is the best with children, especially toddlers and guides them so well as they grow up. We all love her and are still in touch. She still takes my kids out for a movie, gives them presents atleast once a year.",

In just a short time the anxiety disappeared and he now loves being around kids and the crowd no longer scares him.\r\nSoranyi is an extremely hardworking, punctual and honest individual who will love and care for your child just as much as you. She is extremely knowledgeable about infant and toddler development and helps build the right skills in the baby through play, story times, singing and arts. She makes amazing home cooked baby food which a lot of times we have ended eating as well. My toddler has definitely flourished under her care. He loves and adores her! With us moving to a different state we have to say bye to her. If I could I would pack her up and take her with us! If you need the best of care that includes lots of love with good skill development, Soranyi is the perfect nanny for you.",
