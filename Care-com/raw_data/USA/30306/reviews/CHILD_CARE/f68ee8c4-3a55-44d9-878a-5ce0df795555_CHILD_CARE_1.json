I will never forget being gone from home and to my surprise the kids had done paintings! They were so excited to show me. She has a gift with kids and they love her. She has helped with homework, arts and craft, does my daughterâ€™s hair, and a bonafide chef in the kitchen! She is amazing! If you want someone that you can trust to look after your kids and know they are safe I highly recommend Makiya. A true mature and professional lady.",
