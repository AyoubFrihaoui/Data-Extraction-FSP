It was a family member instead who used her profile Florentina is her name . I ended up having a long conversation with Florentina , who was the nanny who showed up and informed me that she was using Elmates account . I explained how that was a major red flag and safety concern and that she needed to create her own account. Which she did do. She showed up to three assignments, 1 callout the day before and then eventually quit . I was content with her role in the short amount of time she served but due to calling out and quitting the day before it jeopardized my position with work which impacts my overall livelihood . I wish her well",
