            "displayText": "Elizabeth has been helping care for my two children (2 years and 4 months).  She is amazing.  If I didn't have an au pair coming to live with my family next month, I would definitely hire Elizabeth on a full-time basis.  Elizabeth is always on time (early in fact) and is very reliable.  She communicates everything that she wants to do with the kids before she does anything and is very proactive.  We are new to our community and she has been finding new places for the kids to go (without me even asking) and making play dates!  My son just loves spending time with her.  We will be very sad to say goodbye to Elizabeth!",

            "displayText": "What can I say? She is like mother earth. It absolutely comes natural for her. She responded in like 10 minutes and I was able to meet her that day. My two girls were very calm around her and there was just a great chemistry. She is sweet and down to earth. She was never late, never missed a beat. She never rushed out the door and told me everything my kids ate, how many times they pooped and peed without me even asking. My girls absolutely love her! She baked with them, played with them, took them outside and everything. They had a great time. I couldn't ask for anything more. My oldest can be difficult but with Elizabeth there were no complaints, she just played with her and kept up with my daughter's energy and everything worked out great. My youngest doesn't speak very much but Elizabeth clearly understood when she was hungry, what she wanted to eat and had no problems making it for her. I hope to work with her again, it is very rare to find a young woman that is so graceful, patient and so natural with children. My family adores her.",
