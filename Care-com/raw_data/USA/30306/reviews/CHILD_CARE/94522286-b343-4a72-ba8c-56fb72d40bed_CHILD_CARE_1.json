            "displayText": "Cheyenne was a no-show this morning for her first scheduled shift. We were very excited to have her start. She had a great background, etc., so I hired her to watch our 6 month old infant on an ongoing basis Thursdays now through early October, then picking up Tuesdays in mid October. \r\n\r\nYesterday morning, she texted me to confirm the 8:30am-4:30pm shift, and I confirmed back. That evening she texted back saying that she could no longer work the bulk of the Thursdays we had scheduled her for because the other family she works for asked her to stay on later and that she \"can still come tomorrow [i.e.-today] and the 20th still while you find another sitter.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as I saw the message very early this morning, I replied, \"okay, let's talk when you get here.\" To which she replied that she was not coming this morning.She really put us in a bind. If you hire her - be sure to confirm her shift the night before you go to bed and the morning before she gets there so this does not happen to you.",
