Our child has thrived under Jermeala’s guidance, they come home each day excited to share what they’ve learned. The creative activities, nurturing environment, and attention to each child’s unique needs have made a world of difference. We feel so fortunate to have Jermeala as part of our child’s early education journey and we highly recommend them to any parent seeking a dedicated and loving teacher and caregiver.",
