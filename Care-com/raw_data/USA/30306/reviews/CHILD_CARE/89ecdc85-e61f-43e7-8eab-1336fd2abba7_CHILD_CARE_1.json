She is hard working and has a very kind, patient, loving and calm demeanor that was such a great a balance for my energetic boys (age 4 & 6).  Alexis was our nanny and house manager for a year and still babysits for us.  She is dependable and leaves the house cleaner than she found it.  She’s very reliable and we love having her in our home.  Our boys adore her and all the fun and love she gives them!!!  Would hire her any time! ",
