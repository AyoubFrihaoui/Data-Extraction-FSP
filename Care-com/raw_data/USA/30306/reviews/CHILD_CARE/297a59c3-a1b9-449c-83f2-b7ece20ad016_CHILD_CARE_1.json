He was very patient and kind with my autistic son, keeping him calm and safe (and fed!) while I was at work. Eddie was also 100% punctual every day, immediately responsive to all my texts, and very flexible if something came up at work and I needed him to stay a bit longer.\nI will definitely be requesting Eddie's services again in the future should we need them, would highly recommend Eddie to anyone!\nThanks again Eddie for all your help with my son!",
