She instantly connected with my toddler (who is slow to warm to people) and was a natural with my newborn. She is knowledgeable, recognizes milestones and meets our children where they’re at developmentally. She is engaged with them from the moment she arrives until she leaves (reading, singing, chasing them around the house, building forts, taking them to parks etc). In addition to providing childcare (which includes school drop off/pick up for our older son) she spends any spare moment picking up the house, doing laundry and cooking (she’s an AMAZING cook). If my house was bigger I’d beg her to move in with us- ha! She has truly become a part of our family and we are so incredibly lucky to have found her❤️",
