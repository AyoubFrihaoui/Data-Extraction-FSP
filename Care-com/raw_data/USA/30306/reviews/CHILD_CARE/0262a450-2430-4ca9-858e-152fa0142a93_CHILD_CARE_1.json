            "displayText": "Rose has been one of my closest friends for the past 20 years. I have known her through all her past nannying jobs and have seen her become part of the families that she cares for. She is loving, caring, beyond responsible and has the kindest heart. She is energetic, athletic and can keep up with the busiest of kids but is also gentle and loving with younger children. Rose will put your children first in all cases and make sure they are happy and completely cared for. Rose is definitely my top recommendation when it comes to the perfect child care provider!",
