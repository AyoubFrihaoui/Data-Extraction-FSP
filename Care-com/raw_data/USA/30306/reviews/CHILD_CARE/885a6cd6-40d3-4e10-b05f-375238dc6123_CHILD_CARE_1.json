            "displayText": "Mariah had volunteered two to three days a week every summer from age 10 to 18. She was the granddaughter of a friend and I was an executive director of an adult day care for persons with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and dementia.  She always seemed interested in my stories so one summer I took her to work with me..she was like a duck to water sitting next to my seniors talking to them, playing games, dancing and doing crafts..as time went on she was doing more doing one on one crafts helping some calm down serving meals and walking to the bathroom . Dancing special shows. And acrobatics was her specialty. She was never afraid of my clients and calmed some down. She has a special gift with people that have disabilities. I retired last year but I was looking forward to hiring her for the summer. Last two summers she baby sat her little brothers for her dad and step mom. As she completed her first year of college I am excited for her to teach. Mariah would be an asset to anyone who hires her.",
