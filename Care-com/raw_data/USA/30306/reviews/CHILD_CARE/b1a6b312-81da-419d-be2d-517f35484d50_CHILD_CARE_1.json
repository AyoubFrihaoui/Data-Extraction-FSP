From the very first moment, it was clear that she is not only professional but genuinely passionate about working with children. Our little one felt at ease, and we could tell they were having a wonderful time from the moment we left.\n\nThe communication was seamless, she kept us updated with regular check-ins, sharing sweet photos and little anecdotes about the day. It was so reassuring to know our child was in such capable hands, and we had complete peace of mind.\n\nWhat really stood out was how thoughtful and engaging Priscilla  was. She went above and beyond to create a fun, structured environment with activities that were both entertaining and educational. Our child absolutely adored her and was already asking when she would come back!\n\nWe are incredibly grateful for the care and attention Priscilla provided. We highly recommend her to any parent looking for a trustworthy and kind-hearted sitter. Thank you again for making our time away so stress-free!\n",
