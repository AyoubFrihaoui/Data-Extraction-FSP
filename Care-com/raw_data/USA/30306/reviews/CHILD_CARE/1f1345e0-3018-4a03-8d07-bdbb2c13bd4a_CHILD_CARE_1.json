From day 1, she was on top of everything, always bringing a blend of professional commitment and warmth to our home. She's got a knack for understanding kids and what they need; she could write a how-to book on nannying/babysitting.\n\nWhat really makes Shina stand out is how she connects with kids of all ages, from babies to grade-schoolers and older. During her time with us, our kids didn't just get older - they really grew as individuals. We had to say goodbye because our kids are now too old for a nanny, but Shina's impact will last their whole lives. She's a genuinely kind person full of good ideas, boundless energy, and a foundational love for kids.",
