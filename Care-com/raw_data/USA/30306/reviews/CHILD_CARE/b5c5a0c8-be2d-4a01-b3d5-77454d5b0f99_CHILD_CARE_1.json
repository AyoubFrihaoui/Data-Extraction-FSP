She is always fully engaged when sitting our kids and even brings activities to do with them. She is wonderfully positive, always patient and kind with our kids, who can be a handful! We've also recommended her to several friends who have also had the same experience and now use her regularly. Highly recommend her no matter your kids ages and whether you need an evening sitter or someone to watch your kids over the weekend! ",
