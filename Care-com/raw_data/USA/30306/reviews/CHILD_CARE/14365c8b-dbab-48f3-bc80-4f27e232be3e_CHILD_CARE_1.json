            "displayText": "Celia contacted us on 1/12 about our job opening. Over the next 4 days we messaged, video chatted, & she came to our home to meet our kids (1/16). We were impressed & moved forward w/ hiring her. On 1/25, she shadowed our current nanny for 5 hours. We paid her & got ready for her to start on 1/30. On 1/26, we had Care run the Criminal+MVR check. We let Celia know but she didn't respond. We reached out multiple times over the next few days but heard absolutely nothing back. She finally reached out the morning she was supposed to start. By that point we had decided not to hire her. She then provided 4 different excuses for why she was out of contact for 5 days & she also told us she wasn't comfortable w/ the Criminal+MVR check. Celia seemed like she would be a great fit for our family & she seemed like we could trust her with our kids. It is hard not to be upset given the amount of time and energy we spent talking to her, welcoming her into our home, and setting her up as our new nanny.",
