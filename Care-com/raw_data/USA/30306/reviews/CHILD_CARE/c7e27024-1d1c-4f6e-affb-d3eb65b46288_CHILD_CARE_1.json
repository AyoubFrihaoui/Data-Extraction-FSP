I appreciated that she asked me thoughtful questions about the use of space around where I work.  She got my child to do all of his necessary after-school activities and then they did fun stuff that wasn't screen-based. My child said he had a great time and looks forward to Nathalie's visit. Overall, I would recommend booking with Nathalie and I will certainly be asking her to come back the next time we need childcare.",
