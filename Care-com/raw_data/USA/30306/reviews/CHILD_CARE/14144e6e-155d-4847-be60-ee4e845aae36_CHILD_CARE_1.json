She was our full-time nanny but now both of our kids are in school so we only need a part-time nanny.  We wish she could go part-time.  Our kids absolutely love her.  She did lessons with them, crafts, play time, etc... She took them to parks for them to have Playtime.  She prepared their meals and got them prepared for all of their activities.  Tazia helped me out so much in our house.  She acted as a house manager as well.  She picks up on things really quick and helped me keep things organized and in order.  She is the nicest person you will ever meet.  We will miss her dearly and we hope that she will find a deserving and loving family that she will love.  ",
