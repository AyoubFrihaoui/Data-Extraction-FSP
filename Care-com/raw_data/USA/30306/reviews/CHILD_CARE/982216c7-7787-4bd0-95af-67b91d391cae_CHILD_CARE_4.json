She started watching my 1 year old during the day while the other three were at school and did a great job with the baby.  On nights when she's had all of my kids, I have not had a single worry that they weren't being taken care of.  They always have enjoyed their time with her, since she plays lots of games with them.  She communicates really well when she isn't going to be available and is always on time.  I couldn't ask for a better, more trustworthy babysitter.\nThank you Tricia!",
