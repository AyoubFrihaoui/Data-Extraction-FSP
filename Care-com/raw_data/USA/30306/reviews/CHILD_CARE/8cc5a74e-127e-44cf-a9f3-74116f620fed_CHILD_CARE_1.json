As her mother, I have observed her over these many years as she has babysat and educated the many children placed in her care. As I observed her many times in our home as she took diligent, loving, and thoughtful responsibility for her brother or niece, I was overwhelmed with her kindness, respect, and guidance she gave these young children. Eliza's loving nature provided a feeling of calm and trust in them. I was so impressed and touched with seeing her getting down on their level to look them kindly in the eyes as she cheerfully and clearly communicated with them her expectations and enthusiasm. Eliza's supervision and excitement in directing the children to interesting and engaging activities and projects were greatly appreciated, as well. Most importantly, I felt complete peace knowing the children were in safe hands while in her care.",
