Leaving my 5-month old with someone I truly didn't know to return to work was hard, however Lisa made it the easiest experience for me. She went the extra mile to make sure I felt comfortable to leave my baby in her hands. She would research and learn what was necessary for my baby's development each month. She shared a summary on how his day went everyday. She brought him books and toys that helped when he was teething. Not only was she punctual, but she would come in early sometimes too. It became apparent to me that she truly cares and loves my baby. \r\n\r\nLisa has great work ethics, and is a gentle and caring woman.
