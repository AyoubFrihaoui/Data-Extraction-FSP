It is easy to see at first, her positive personality. She is an open communicator and follows through with tasks and responsibilities. With the children, her patience can't be matched. She has a tool box filled with behavior management techniques and entertainment ideas. She is open and willing to learn new tactics to help children overcome new obstacles. On top of being great with the kids, Ms. Taylor has an array of skills from cooking to handiwork around the house. She is a problem solver and always ready to tackle anything that pops up. In all, Ms. Taylor is a positive, reliable, and very capable nanny. Any family would be very lucky to have her and we can't recommend more.",
