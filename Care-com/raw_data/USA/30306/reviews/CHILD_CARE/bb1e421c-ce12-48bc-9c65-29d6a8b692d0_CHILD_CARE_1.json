From the moment she arrived, she was warm, attentive, and instantly connected with my children. Her patience and ability to keep them entertained with fun activities were truly impressive.\n\nNot only did Chimdi make sure they were happy and engaged, but she also handled their routines perfectly — from mealtime to bedtime, everything went smoothly. She kept me updated throughout the evening, which gave me so much peace of mind.\n\nIt’s clear that she genuinely cares about children, and her professionalism shines through in everything she does. My kids couldn’t stop talking about how much fun they had! I would highly recommend Chimdi to anyone looking for a reliable, caring, and wonderful babysitter. We can’t wait to have her back!",
