            "originalText": "Having Jahnai as our nanny for the past seven months has been an absolute blessing for our family. From the moment she started, she has brought a sense of calm, joy, and reliability into our home. Our 18-month-old daughter has flourished under her care, and we couldn't be more grateful for everything Jahnai has done for us and our daughter.\n\nJahnai, or Nai as we lovingly know her, has an incredible way with children. She is very patient and kind. Our daughter, who was only used to being watched and cared for by family, took about 2 weeks to warm up to Nai, during this period, Nai was very patient, kind and never too pushy. They're now inseparable, our daughter quite literally jumps for joy when she sees her in the morning! Nai reads to our daughter, takes her to the park and multiple other activities through the week. She is very good at keeping track of all the classes and play sessions we have for our daughter and also schedules them when needed. There have been several afternoons where I have walked in on them having a dance party in our living room, you should see the look of joy on our daughter's face! Nai has been instrumental in nurturing our daughter to be curious, kind and empathetic.\n\nOne of the things we appreciate most about Nai is her attentiveness to our daughter's needs. She is always in tune with her moods and knows exactly how to comfort her when she's upset or restless. Nai has a natural ability to make our daughter feel safe and loved. She can also be firm when dealing with tantrums and meltdowns. \n\nNai helped us wean our daughter off the bottle and even started to potty train her. On days when our daughter has been sick, Nai took utmost care to make sure that she's comfortable. She would regularly take her temperature, help with giving her medicines, and even sit with her in the bathroom for steam showers!\n\nNai is very reliable and flexible. She has given us plenty of notice when she's had to take time off so that we can make other arrangements for childcare. She has also adjusted her schedule to suit our needs during busy work weeks. She respects our routines and household rules, and she always goes above and beyond to ensure everything runs smoothly. Her proactive nature and willingness to help with household tasks have been a tremendous support to us. Throughout the day, she helps us with the dishes and preps for our meals. She also manages 100% of our daughter's laundry and meals. She even picked up some Indian recipes for her!\n\nIn summary, Nai is an exceptional nanny who has made a significant positive impact on our daughter's life and our family as a whole. Her dedication, warmth, and expertise have provided our daughter with a nurturing and stimulating environment to grow and thrive. We wholeheartedly recommend Nai to any family seeking a loving and dependable caregiver. Thank you, Nai, for everything you do. We are so lucky to have you in our lives. <3\n\n\n",
