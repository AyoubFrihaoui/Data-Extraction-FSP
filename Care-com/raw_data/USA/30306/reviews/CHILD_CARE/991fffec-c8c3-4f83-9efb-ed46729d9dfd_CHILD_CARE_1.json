She adapted seamlessly as we made adjustments to fit his ever-changing needs, always ensuring that he felt secure and supported. Her flexibility and keen insight into child development made her an invaluable part of our family’s routine.\n\nJoan’s ability to manage multiple responsibilities and her willingness to go the extra mile make her an invaluable asset. To know Joan is to love her, and I have no doubt that she will bring the same level of commitment, heart, and enthusiasm to any family that she works with. ",
