Jaberia helped our daughter to develop motor skills that set her on a great path. Our baby loves Jaberia and smiled so big when she arrived every morning. I would definitely recommend hiring Jaberia as your nanny and/or babysitter. Sheâ€™s a kind soul and very trustworthy. Always arrived on time and came early if needed. ",
