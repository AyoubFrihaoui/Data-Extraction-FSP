            "originalText": "Shawna was LITERALLY heaven sent!!! Our neighbor found her on care.com and referred her to us. At the time, she didn't have availability to take us on FT,  so we shared her and eventually she became FT (M-F). Our newborn baby had medical needs - he was on oxygen, a feeding tube, and a pulse oximeter and none of this scared Shawna. Although it was out of the norm, she learned along with us and helped us to nurse this baby through feeding challenges and growth challenges. A year later and she has taught him so much - this kid loves being read books (he will go get a book and bring it to me), he's learning the ABC's in sign language, and is meeting all age appropriate milestones and is able to finally go to daycare and fit into population with the other babies!  Since he's our first kid, I can honestly say that Shawna taught us so much - I thought I was prepared after reading books and such, but her expertise surpassed it all. She taught us so many tips and tricks and made us aware of hazards that we would have never known existed. She would send me Amazon links of the things that we needed that we didn't know we needed. As he grew, she'd let us know which age appropriate toys he should be playing with. In the year that Shawna spent with our family, I can not even count with one hand how many times she turned on the TV - she is very traditional in her approach of teaching babies. She also helped us to sleep train our little man. Even with his health challenges, he became an independent sleeper and on a schedule at just 6 months old! That in itself helped us to have household balance. I can seriously write more and more and more and never stop giving thanks to Shawna and how blessed we were to have crossed paths with her!!! Even after Shawna's FT assignment with us was over, she offered to care for our little guy for date nights and vacations. We are ever thankful!!",
