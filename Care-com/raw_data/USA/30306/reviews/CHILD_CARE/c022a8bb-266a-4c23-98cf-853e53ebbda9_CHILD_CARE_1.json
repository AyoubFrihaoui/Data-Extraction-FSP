She was always dependable, on time, and would stay late as needed when I was running behind on work or errands. As a single mother, I really appreciated the extra help and care Emma provided and feel so lucky to have found her. Not to mention my girls adore her, she was always doing fun activities with them and was a great help with homework/school activities as well. We miss her very much since she moved to Savannah but I know she will be a blessing to the next family!",
