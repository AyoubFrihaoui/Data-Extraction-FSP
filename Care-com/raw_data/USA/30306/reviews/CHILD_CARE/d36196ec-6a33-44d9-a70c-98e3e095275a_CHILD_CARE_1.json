Keri made deep, lasting connections with both of our kids, from age 0-4. She took them out on outings, designed lovely sensory and arts & crafts activities, and made them feel taken care of and loved. Her philosophy was also always how can she make our lives as parents better -- my home was always neater when Keri left than when she came. We were devastated when our two families outgrew a nanny share, but Keri stayed close to our kids and our family. Any family would be incredibly lucky to have Keri as part of their family.",

I truly relied on her input about their needs and worked with her to ensure those needs were met.
