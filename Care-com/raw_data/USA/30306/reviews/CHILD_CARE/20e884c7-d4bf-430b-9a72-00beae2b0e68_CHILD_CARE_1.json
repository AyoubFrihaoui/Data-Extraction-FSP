We call her the baby whisperer because very quickly it was clear that caretaking for children is her gift and passion.  She was always early, excited to care for the kids, and very detail oriented in the kidâ€™s schedule and completion of responsibilities.  She went above and beyond to help keep things organized and spent time helping the twins with their milestones.  As two working professionals, it was a relief to have someone as professional, loving, and passionate as Yamilet caretaking for our twins as if they were family.  We still call on Yamilet for care on nights and weekends when she is available. And, would highly recommend her for anyone looking for a seasoned bi-lingual nanny. ",
