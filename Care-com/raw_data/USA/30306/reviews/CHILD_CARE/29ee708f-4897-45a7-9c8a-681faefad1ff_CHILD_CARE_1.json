The warmth, care and talent that she displays is unparalleled. She's originally from Argentina so is overtly loving and gregarious. (I remember the first day I met her - at her home when I went to interview her to watch my older daughter. She insisted I come for breakfast. When she opened the front door, she hugged and kissed me. This is Liz.) She's also a very talented artist, weaver and crafts person and she inspires creativity in children with outings, art projects and other exploration. She's easygoing and my children adored her. When I had family emergencies, etc., my children stayed with her in her home for extended periods of time. Liz has two of  her own school-aged children who are also lovely. If you're looking for someone to not only care for your child(ren) but to nurture them and foster their growth, Liz is amazing!",
