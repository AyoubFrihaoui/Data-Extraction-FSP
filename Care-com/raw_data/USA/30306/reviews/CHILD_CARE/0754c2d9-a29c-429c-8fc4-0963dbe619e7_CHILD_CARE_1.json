She is trustworthy, reliable, communicative and loving and my daughter lights up whenever she arrives at our house! Great with toddler activities and meal prepping and always follows our schedule and knows what our baby needs. Highly recommend Ingrid for any needs you have whether it be caregiving or organizing. She always leaves our house spotless after she leaves as well.  She truly is the best!!!",
