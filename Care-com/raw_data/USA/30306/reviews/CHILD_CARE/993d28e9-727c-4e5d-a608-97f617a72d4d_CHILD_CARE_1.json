She started working with us when our daughters were in elementary school, and over time, she became so much more than just a nanny—she became family.\n\nClaire is trustworthy and responsible. She is kind, patient, and genuine. Now the girls are grown and don’t need a nanny, we still turn to Claire for house and dog sitting. \n\nShe has an incredible way with children, making them feel safe, supported, and loved. It has been such a joy to watch our girls grow up with her. Our daughters continue to be close with Claire and spend time together often.\n\nAny family would be lucky to have her. We cannot recommend Claire highly enough. ",
