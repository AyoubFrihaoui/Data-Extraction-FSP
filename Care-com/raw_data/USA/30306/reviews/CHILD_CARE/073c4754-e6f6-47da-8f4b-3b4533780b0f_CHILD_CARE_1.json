I have been consistently impressed with Varshay’s ability to provide a safe, nurturing, and stimulating environment for my children.\n\nVarshay has a genuine love for children and is able to connect with them on a deep level. She is patient, kind, and has a playful nature that children respond well to. Varshay is also highly responsible and reliable, always showing up on time and keeping me informed of my children’s daily activities and development.\n\nIn addition to providing excellent care, Varshay has also demonstrated a strong commitment to the overall development of my children. She has been an active participant in developing daily activities that are age-appropriate and that help my children grow socially, emotionally, and intellectually.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend Varshay as a nanny. She would be an asset to any family and I am confident that she will provide the same high level of care and dedication to any child she will be entrusted with in the future.",
