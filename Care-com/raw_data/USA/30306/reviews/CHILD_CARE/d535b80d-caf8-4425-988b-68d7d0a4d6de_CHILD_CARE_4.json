She is patient, loving, genuinely loves kids, and was able to keep our daughter on a good schedule.  She has a warm and happy personality that makes her great with kids. Our daughter enjoyed her time with Emily and I felt good leaving her in Emily's hands. In addition, because my baby slept for a good part of the day, Emily helped us with light housekeeping- dishes and laundry mainly. A big help!
