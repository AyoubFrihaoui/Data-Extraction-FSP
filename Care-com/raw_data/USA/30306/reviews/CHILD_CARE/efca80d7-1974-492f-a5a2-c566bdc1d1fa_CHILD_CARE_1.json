            "originalText": "Rianna joined our family to watch our 4 month old baby girl last August. A friend referred her to us and noted her childhood development and childcare experience which we preferred our nanny have. Over the months we had Rianna in our home we watched our baby girl learn new things daily.  Rianna provided interactive play and a safe space for our little girl. She taught our baby sign language which was completely unexpected but amazing. We now have a 17 month old who has a vocabulary of over 150 clearly spoken words. Rianna definitely helped establish that knowledge. She also helped guide us in knowing appropriate developmental milestones. \n\nIn terms of our working relationship, Rianna was friendly and social. She tidied up after herself and the baby. She was willing to help in anyway we requested and was cautious of the food allergies we live with. She communicates well with parents and family. She is extremely reliable and was always on time. \n\nWe were so sad to see Rianna go but our baby started daycare shortly after Rianna graduated. That being said, Rianna stays in touch and has visited since moving away. Our baby still looks at her picture and says “Anna” regularly. We are so happy to have had Rianna in our home. She made a huge impact in our lives as first time parents and in our baby’s development. \n",
