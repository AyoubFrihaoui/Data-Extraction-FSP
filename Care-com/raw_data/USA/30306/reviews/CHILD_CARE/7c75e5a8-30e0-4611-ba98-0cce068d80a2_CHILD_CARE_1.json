She watched my five children (5-17). She managed all home duties and assisted me during the day while my children were at school. She helped keep my house organized, she up kept all cleaning, she did all of our laundry, she meal prepped our meals, and would run all needed errands.\nShe would then pick up all kids from school.\nShe would prepare their daily snacks and daily dinners for our family. She maintained the children's routines and coordinated everyone's extra curricular activities. She was truly a blessing to our family. We are forever grateful for our time with us. Her and her son will both always be near and dear to our family.",
