Always the ultimate professional,  Ngolela's experience with children is clearly evident. She is caring, joyful, insightful, attentive, creative, independent, and respectful. She is everything you could hope to find in a caregiver and more. From the moment I heard her singing to our infant girl, to the time I found myself in tears flipping through the scrapbook she made for our daughter's first birthday, I could not believe how lucky we were to have Ngolela in our lives. She has loved our baby girl as we do, and I don't think you can ask for anything more.",

She always has a cheerful disposition, and we love the energy and enthusiasm she brings into our home each morning. She has a special ability to engage with kids of all ages, and my children adore her. Ngolela loves planning adventures and excursions for the kids, and I rely on her knowledge of events and activities around the city. She is happy to juggle as many balls (and children) as we throw at her! She designs clothing in her free time, and she has sewn pajamas and mended stuffed animals for the kids. But most importantly, she is kind, reliable, fun, punctual, organized and exactly the type of person you would want to be with your children in your absence. I highly recommend Ngolela!",
