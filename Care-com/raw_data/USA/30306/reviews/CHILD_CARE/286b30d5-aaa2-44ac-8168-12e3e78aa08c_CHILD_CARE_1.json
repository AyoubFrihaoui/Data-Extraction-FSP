When we had our daughter in 2019, Shadia was the FIRST person we thought of to spend time with our C as we got back to work. We chose Shadia not only because I've known her for over a decade. We chose her for her child-focused, culturally inclusive way of tending to the children in her care. Shadia was no \"babysitter\". She took painstaking time to truly understand C as a tiny human with her own thoughts, feelings, and perspective on the world. We chose Shadia for her loving, caring, and intensely passionate views regarding the emotional, physical, and eternal growth of our daughter. Our C has loved Shadia since their first interaction. In today's world and specifically my profession, having such quality, professional, child-focused care has been, thankfully, something we have never worried over - because we had our Shadia. ",
