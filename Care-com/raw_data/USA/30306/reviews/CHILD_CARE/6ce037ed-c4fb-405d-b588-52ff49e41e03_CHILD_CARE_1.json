She is kind and warm, and creative in ways to spend time with her clients.  My Dad loved her and looked forward to their time together.\r\nMy Dad had asked her to take care of me and my son after he passed, and even though we are not \"elderly\", Gail has kept our household running ever since!  She comes by twice a week, keeping our house spotless, and running errands, meeting service people, facilitating getting things fixed.  She also is an expert pet sitter, and keeps our two cats and other pet in excellent health and spirits, keeping them fed, clean and healthy.\r\nGail is a member of our family and we would be lost without her.  You could not go wrong working with her for your household, for your elderly loved one, or for your pets.",
