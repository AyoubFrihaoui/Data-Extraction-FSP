At my house we had a nanny share system with a neighbor. The kids would have so much fun with her! Karen would play with them, teach them stuff and take them outside. Karen has always been able to get on my daughters level and make her happy. At the time Karen lived outside of the city and even though she lived far, she was very punctual and dedicated because she cared about the girls. Definitely recommend her!",
