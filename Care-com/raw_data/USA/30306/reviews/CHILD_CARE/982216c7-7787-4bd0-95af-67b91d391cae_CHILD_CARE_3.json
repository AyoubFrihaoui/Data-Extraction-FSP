I am a new mom and to hand my sweet 8 month old girl over to a stranger was more than I could handle. Tricia was so sweet and even CAME WITH ME to the appointment I had & watched baby in another room! My little girl LOVED(S) her! After my appointment Tricia sat with us at a Starbucks for over an hour and was willing to answer any questions I had about her, her growing up, her nannying styles - all of it. She is incredibly patient with my baby, has taught her fun things (waving, peek-a-boo, etc.), reads to her, sings to her, crawls around on the floor with her. One character trait I REALLY APPRECIATE is that she will carry through with actions/directions SPECIFICALLY how I list it out. There is no 2nd guessing on if something will be done right. I ALWAYS come home to a CLEAN HOUSE. I don't mean just toys put away - I mean floors swept, mopped, vacuumed, shelves dusted, clothes washed, dried, hung-up, dishes loaded, emptied, put away... trashes taken out, stove-top cleaned (she is usually here at least a few hours). Basically, if it needs to be done, you can trust it'll be done! I never worry or think my child is in ANYTHING but the BEST of care. She will even text me cute pics or videos when my baby does something new or funny. I would NEVER post a positive remark on anyone I didn't truly believe and know was trustworthy in my home and trustworthy to care for the most precious and irreplaceable thing in my life. We are very grateful for Nanny Tricia at our house! =)",
