She is a terrific caregiver and was able to care for our son wonderfully. She is responsible, reliable and has a lovely disposition! We were quite sad to lose her to the Peace Corps but our loss was their gain!! She is a fantastic person with great interpersonal skills. She is a real gem! I recommend her with no reservations and consider yourself fortunate if she works with your loved one(s). If you need more information Sasha can give you my phone #. Sasha is super competent!",
