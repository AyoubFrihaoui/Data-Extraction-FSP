She has worked with us and cared for our twin 19 month old girls for about 4 months and even in such a short period of time we feel like she is part of the family. She is totally responsible and dependable but the most important thing to us is how wonderful she is with the girls: she is always 100% engaged with them and with two toddlers let me tell you that is not always easy...  Whether it is walks to the park or dance parties in the playroom we always know that the girls are well taken care of and having fun! The girls light up when she comes into the room and I can tell that she loves them as much as they love her which is more than we could have hoped for. In short: Kimberly is a genuinely lovely person and a fabulous nanny who we hope will be part of our lives for a long time.",
