She was able to follow directions given for his feedings and let me know what did and did not work for him as he is trying new solid foods. When I left he was fussy to see me go, but she calmed him down by singing and reading to him and updated me when he had calmed down. My baby felt comfortable enough to nap in her arms! Thank you so much for being amazing Emily. Highly recommend.",
