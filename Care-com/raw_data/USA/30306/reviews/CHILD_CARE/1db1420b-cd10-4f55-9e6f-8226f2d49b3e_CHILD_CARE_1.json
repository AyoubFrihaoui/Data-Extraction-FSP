            "displayText": "Jessica was a nanny for our newborn for 4 months.  The only reason we didn't have her longer is because we actually already had a family friend nanny lined up to start but she wasn't available until August and we needed somebody to start in May.  I came on Care.com to find a temporary nanny and still can't believe how lucky we were to have found Jessica.  She was incredible with our baby.  She loved on him like he was her own and did awesome age-appropriate activities with him - even gave me suggestions on things to have at home for his activity time.  She was extremely punctual and flexible even when I suddenly would need to work extended hours in a given day.  She was such a genuinely kind and caring person and it was so incredibly hard on her last day with us.  She was such a blessing to our family. I would highly recommend Jessica.  She never called in sick, ways ALWAYS early and was just amazing with our child.  I love how she interacted with our baby and how much she helped us.",
