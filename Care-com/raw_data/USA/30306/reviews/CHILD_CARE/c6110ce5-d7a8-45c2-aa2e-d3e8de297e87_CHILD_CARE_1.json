Primarily she looks after our (very picky/people selective) infant on a regular schedule, and they are great together. We love she is so experienced with small children there isn't much direction I need to give her because she already knows the ends & outs of caring for kids. \r\nShe is always on time, professional and responsible. I would highly recommend her to any family looking for someone to care for their children.",
