After trading messages on Care, she provided references.  We contacted the references and they were all glowing.  We then scheduled a meet and greet with us and our daughter.  Portia was very nice and our daughter took to her right away.  We agreed on a rate and a start date.  And we paid Portia for her time during the meet and greet.  As the start date approached, we reached out to Portia.  No response.  We reached out again a couple of days later.  No response.  We tried calling, no response.  We have yet to hear anything from her at all.\n\nIf you do decide to hire her, make sure you have a backup plan.",
