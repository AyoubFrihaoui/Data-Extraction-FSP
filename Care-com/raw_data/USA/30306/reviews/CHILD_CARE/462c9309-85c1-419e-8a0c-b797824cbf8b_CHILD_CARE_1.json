            "originalText": "Andrea has been with us since our son since her was 3 weeks old. He is now 7 months and is entering daycare and we are sad to no longer have regular time with her. She has been a blessing for our family. She is warm, kind, thoughtful and loving. She has a natural way with children, patient and observant, engaging and fun. We have been incredibly lucky to have found such a gem of a person.\n\nAndrea has over 10 years of experience as a nanny, taking care of children of various ages. She is based in Stone Mountain, and is open to working with families across Atlanta. She is also available for evening and weekend babysitting as needed. \n\nDuring her time with us, Andrea created a fun and engaging environment for our son. She kept him entertained with music and stimulating activities. She also made sure he spent time on his tummy and sitting up with support. She listened to our directions and always shared her observations about new things our son was doing. We are grateful for the time we got to spend with Andrea. As first time parents, she is exactly what we needed. ",
