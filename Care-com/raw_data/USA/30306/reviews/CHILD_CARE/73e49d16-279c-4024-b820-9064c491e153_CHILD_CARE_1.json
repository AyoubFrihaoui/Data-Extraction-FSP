My kids ask for her regularly, and we cherish the ad hoc babysitting nights we get with her.",

Her playful energy, seamless language transitions between Spanish and basic English, and ability to blend fun with education made her indispensable. Gaby's hardworking and organized approach, coupled with her excellent cooking skills, eliminated the stress of parenting.  She would manage inventory of items and follow a schedule that fostered a great routine. Transitioning from her care to school was a challenge, as her developmentally appropriate activities and genuine connection with our kids are unmatched. We still turn to Gaby when needed, and our children's joy upon seeing her speaks volumes about her lasting impact. Highly recommend for any family seeking a reliable, fun, and nurturing caregiver.",
