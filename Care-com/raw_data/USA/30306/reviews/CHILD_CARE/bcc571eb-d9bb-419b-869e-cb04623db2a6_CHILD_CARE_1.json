Our daughter absolutely ADORES her! She is so experienced, so responsible and so reliable. Sometimes, I trust Ruth more with the baby than I do myself! :) She's easygoing which is great for us but disciplined which is great for our daughter. We appreciate the fact that she's willing to find fun, creative things to do with her as well. We are so blessed to have found Ruth and she's like family now. She'll definitely always be a part of our lives whether she is watching our daughter or not. I would just encourage anyone out there looking to hire her if you get the chance before someone else does! She's irreplaceable!",
