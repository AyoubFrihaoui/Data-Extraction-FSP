Moreover how she really doubt the \"nannying\" skills of anyone who showed interest in my job given that it's a short duration with possible extension. She didn't showed any interest to know anything about the baby or what I services looking for. She may be good as a nanny but need some training on behavioral skills. Disappointing :(",
