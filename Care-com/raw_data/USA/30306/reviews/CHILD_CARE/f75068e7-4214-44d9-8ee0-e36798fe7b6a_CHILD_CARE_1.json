            "originalText": "Our family is incredibly fortunate to have found such a remarkable nanny. From the moment she joined us in 2020, it was evident that she was not just a caregiver, but a nurturing presence who truly loves and understands our son. She has been with our family since our son was 2-year-old and our soon to be first grader truly adores her! \nShe goes above and beyond to ensure that our child’s needs are met with patience, kindness, and genuine interest. Whether it's preparing nutritious meals, organizing creative activities, or simply lending a listening ear, she consistently exceeds our expectations. She has exceptional communication skills and keeps us informed about our child’s daily routines, and any concerns that may arise. Her open and transparent approach has fostered a strong sense of trust and partnership between us. She is punctual, responsible, and always willing to accommodate our family's schedule changes with grace and flexibility. We have complete peace of mind knowing that our son is in her capable hands. We are truly grateful for her for everything she has done for our family!",
