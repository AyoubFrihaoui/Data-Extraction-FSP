The kids love her and she took care of them as if they were her own children. We've brought Jazmine on trips with us and consider her a member of the family. My husband and I both work and Jazmine was always on time and dependable. The only reason we parted ways is because the twins are enrolling in preschool. We love Jazmine!",
