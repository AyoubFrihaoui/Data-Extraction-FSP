I was a first time mom when she came to us and she made me feel completely comfortable leaving my son with her. Elizabeth never missed a beat! She is very observant and always communicated any questions and/or concerns she had and also sent me pictures of my son during the day. This made me so happy! I was able to somewhat be there with my son in spirit because of the pictures she sent. Elizabeth was a great part of my family and I would recommend her for any family. She left us in June of 2012 when she had her daughter. My family and I also relocated to another state and she couldn't come with us. We love Elizabeth and I'm positive anyone else who chooses her will also.",
