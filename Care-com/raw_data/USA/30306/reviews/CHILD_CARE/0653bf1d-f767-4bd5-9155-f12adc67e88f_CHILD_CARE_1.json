            "displayText": "So lucky to have found Alauna. She was our nanny from 4 months to 1 year. She became basically part of the family. She has never been late or called out sick. She is caring, fun, and genuinely enjoys being with children. She goes above and beyond, making healthy and creative food for my son. He is always entertained, well dressed and well fed. I trust her with my child more than anyone else. She has a lot of functional experience and tips, yet knows how to collaborate and listen if you want something done a specific way. We're heartbroken to see her go, but is moving out of our service area. I could not ask for a better caregiver, she will be sorely missed. I really can't recommend her enough.",
