            "originalText": "Wante is the kindest most caring nanny I could have ever found. She was so attentive and loving with my daughter from 5 months to 15 months. The only reason I don’t have her now is because we moved out of state. I even preferred Wante’s care over some family members and would often ask her to baby-sit for date nights and long day trips as well. I trusted Wante to be home alone and knew that she had my daughter’s routine down to a science and I was confident she was well taken care of. I personally believe my daughter learned to talk early because of Wante’s frequent conversations and friendly interactions during playtime. She read to her, listened to music and just had the best time when ever she was with her. Wante had amazing communication with us and was adaptable to our family needs. I can’t say enough kind things about her. She’s THE BEST! ",
