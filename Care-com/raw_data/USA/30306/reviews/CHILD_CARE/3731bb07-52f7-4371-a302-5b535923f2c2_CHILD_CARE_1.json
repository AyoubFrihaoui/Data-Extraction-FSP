            "originalText": "Emilita worked with my family watching our 1.5 year old for 4 months while I was solo-parenting due to my husband being out of town for an extended time for work. With the circumstances at hand, my number one priority was a caregiver who was reliable and flexible. Emilita was that and so much more! In addition to always showing up on time and never needing to be reminded of the routine, she grew a strong bond with my daughter quickly. She was playful when it was time, but stern when necessary too. She taught my daughter many words, gestures, and tantrum coping mechanisms like breathing/counting. She has a heart for taking care of little ones and never let me down. Now that my family is moving away, I wish I could pack her in my suitcase and take her with me.",
