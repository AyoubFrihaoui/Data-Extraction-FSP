She is professional with parents, loving but clear with children.  She was on top of my children's schedules, was a safe driver, helped them with homework, played games with them, was sensitive to their different personalities, cooked well, and managed to make us all fall in love with her. I had to travel more than once and she stayed over night. The children felt safe with her. And I trusted her. Honestly, I wish she could have moved in with us.",
