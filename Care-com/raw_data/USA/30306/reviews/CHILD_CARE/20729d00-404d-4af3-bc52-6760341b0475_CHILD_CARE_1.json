It was both professional and naturally endearing. A great sense of play, creativity, age appropriate structure and freedom. We worked together for five years and over that time Danna even traveled with us! We were so impressed and grateful for all that she did, that when my cousin gave birth we instantly referred her and she cared for the new born for almost two years. My child is six now and adores her and misses her greatly! I can't recommend her enough. She is an actual angel. ",

She’s comfortable with assessing what a child’s needs are and she takes the time to build a bond with them. She was highly efficient and careful to listen to (and follow), my requests as a parent. She is so kind, empathetic, attentive, full of kind words, and good humor. My favourite thing was to tune into some of the conversations she had with my son about self love, self respect and his ability to do great things.
