Every day she put in effort to be attentive to each child’s unique needs while fostering healthy social and emotional skills in each child. I did not like day cares or schools because I knew my kids would not get the one on one attention they needed but with Shadia they for sure got it. She taught them games that would help with their developmental milestones and helped them learn basic ASL so the babies could communicate with us. She gave them so much love and care that as a mother I didn’t have to worry when I dropped off my kids. I KNEW they were in good hands and in such a busy life that was one less thing I had to worry about. Can’t wait to leave future kids with her as well :)",
