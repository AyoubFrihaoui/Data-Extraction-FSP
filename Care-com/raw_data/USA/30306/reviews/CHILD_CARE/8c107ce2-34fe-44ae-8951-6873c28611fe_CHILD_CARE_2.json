The only reason she is leaving us is because his waitlist spot has come available.  She is with him all day while I work from home (4 days/week) and while I go into the office 1 day.\nVergie is an all around good person - personable, great communicator and a loving nanny.  She treats my child as if he is one of hers.  Her experience in early childhood education through working in daycares along with her experience as a mother makes her experience invaluable.  I am a new mother and Vergie not only cared for my baby but me. I had some post-partum anxiety and Vergie guided me into a routine for us.  She comforted me and made me feel safe, as I came into my new role as a new mother.  While at work, she would send videos and pictures of baby, which made my day.  Vergie has become a part of our family and always will be.  \nI recommend her over and over!  You will not regret the decision. ",
