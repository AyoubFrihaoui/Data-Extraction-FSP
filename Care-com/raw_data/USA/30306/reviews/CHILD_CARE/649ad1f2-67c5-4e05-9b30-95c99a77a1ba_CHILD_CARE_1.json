Please donâ€™t accept an offer or even interview if you are not certain on your availability. Discuss these things with your current employer as you would with any other place of business. You would not accept a new job elsewhere without knowing your end date at your current position or your availability. Treat our lives with the same respect please. I like structure in my life. Ms. Marva seems to be a decent person overall. We set up a virtual FaceTime interview on a Sunday, discussed role as well needs , talked about commitment and communication and the availability . She agreed it was there and it fit her scheduling needs perfect. I offered the position on a Tuesday. She accepted we discussed setting up payment etc. Ms. Marva then notified me the next morning to rescind the acceptance stating her current family will now need her for Fridays as well and she is no longer available. I am now starting the process over hoping to find someone in 2 days of time. Please consider these things. ",

She has been consistently on time, responsible, and reliable.  She has engaged my son in learning - colors, numbers, words, days, months, and Spanish. No joke within 1 week, Ms Marva had the 9-month-old falling asleep and staying asleep in her crib, which had been a struggle - she is a baby whisperer.\nThe best part? Ms Marva likes to have fun - singing, dancing, reading books, being silly, playing games.  Incorporating fun is so important for my kids - and she keeps up with the wild 3-year-old. Ms Marva is like family and has become an important figure in our lives.  I trust her very much. I'm happy to recommend Ms Marva without any reservation.",

            "displayText": "Hiring Marva was one of the best decisions I have made as a mom.\r\n\r\nWhile I was pregnant I had anxiety over who would care for my baby while my husband and I work. With both of our families out of state I prayed to find a local grandmother to watch my baby. \r\n\r\nMy prayers were answered with Marva, a grandmother and baby whispering nanny.\r\nHere are 5 ways she blesses my family each week:\r\n\r\n1. She's reliable. Marva consistently shows up at the agreed upon dates and times. She watches my baby all week and one thing I never have to worry about is whether or not she is coming.\r\n\r\n2. She's loving. Marva clearly loves children and has a way of really connecting with them. If I can't be with my baby all day the next best thing is for her to be with someone who celebrates her, not just tolerates her, and we have that in Marva. My baby loves her.\r\n\r\n3. She's active. My baby is booked and busy with Ms. Marva. They do tummy time multiple times a day, read stories, go on walks, sing and dance. She even introduced my baby to jazz. I love that she doesn't just sit around with the baby watching TV. They actually have full, productive days that aid in development, discovery and growth.\r\n\r\n4. She's solution focused. My baby has come with a number of challenges from really bad gas and re-flux to wanting to be held constantly. Marva came up with a way for us to burp the baby during her feeds without her screaming bloody murder. This has helped her gas and re-flux tremendously. She also has my baby sleeping in her own room. We are now able to put the baby down when she's drowsy and she'll self soothe and go to sleep. Before Marva this was a fantasy.\r\n\r\n5. She has great energy. Ms. Marva is one of those people you meet that you feel like you've known forever. She's easy to communicate with and strikes a balance between following your wishes and leveraging her expertise to maintain the most peaceful, happy environment for everyone. I appreciate that she shows up to work everyday with a positive attitude as it definitely rubs off even after a long night. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I would highly recommend Ms. Marva and would rehire in a heartbeat. Any family who finds her has hit the jackpot.",
