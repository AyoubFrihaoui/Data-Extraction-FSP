She is extremely sweet, detail oriented, extremely clean, attentive, prompt, and communicative. My son gravitated to her instantly which made my heart smile. I love that she is about protecting not only my child but also herself. She was very comfortable about me having cameras in our home and I was happy to see that she also had cameras in her home. She does a fine job making sure that my son is happy and well taken care of while I am away. I am forever grateful for Taylor. As long as I am in Atlanta, she will be my sonâ€™s babysitter. ",
