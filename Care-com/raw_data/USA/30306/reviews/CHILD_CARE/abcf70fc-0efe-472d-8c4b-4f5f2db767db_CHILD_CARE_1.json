She has been with us since he was 4 months old and there isnâ€™t anyone I would trust more than her to give him the best care possible. She set us up for success with a wonderful schedule, activities and is helping us potty train. She set up a calm corner for him to help us figure out tantrums and give him a space to calm down.  She does overnights for us too on occasion. I highly recommend her!",
