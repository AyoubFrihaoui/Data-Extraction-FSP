She arrived on time and hit it off with my 3 year old and 7 month old daughters right away. She sent lots of updates and pictures throughout the day, which I very much appreciated. My 3 year old had a great time with her! They got to play and go outside and even work on learning to read the letters of the alphabet. Chantal went above and beyond and did some cleaning around my home. I highly recommend. ",

From the moment she arrived, she put us at ease with her warmth and experience. \n\nOur toddler can be quite active, but Chantal engaged him with creative games, books, and activities that kept him entertained the entire time we were away. It is clear that Chantal has a natural ability with children, and her background in pediatric medicine gave us even more peace of mind. She showed incredible patience and professionalism throughout.\n\nChantal kept us updated while we were away, sending photos of the kids. It was so reassuring to see how happy they were and how well taken care of, as if they were her own. It’s obvious this isn’t just a job to her—she truly enjoys being with children, and that makes all the difference.\n\nOn top of that, Chantal was very responsive, making the booking process smooth and easy. She was also flexible with scheduling, which we really appreciated. It’s hard for me to trust anyone with my kiddos, but Chantal exceeded all of our expectations. \n\nIf you’re looking for someone who is dependable, attentive, and truly gifted with children, look no further! I highly recommend Chantal and we will definitely be using her again!",
