I loved that she taught them so much—she always kept them engaged, playing, and busy with activities that helped them grow both physically and mentally. She introduced them to games that boosted their intelligence and, on top of that, she spoke to them in Spanish.\n\nI made a special arrangement with her to provide extra payment so she could also teach them to read and write in Spanish, and now my kids are completely bilingual. She no longer works with us because my kids have grown, but I would absolutely hire her again in a heartbeat.\n\nThank you, Marleny! If I could give you more than five stars, I would!\nLaura Schloeter ",
