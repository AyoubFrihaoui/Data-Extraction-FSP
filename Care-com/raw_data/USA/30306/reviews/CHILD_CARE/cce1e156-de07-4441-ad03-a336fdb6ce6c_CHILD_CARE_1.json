I learned about her policy only after I contacted her to see if she received a background check request( as several days had gone by and I still hadn't received the req.) I was very clear in my initial messages on care.com and during our two conversations about the need for 3-4 days a week. I'm extremely busy and it felt like she didn't value my time, I could have saved a lot of time if she would have stated her policy for a signed contact/ full time work to receive a background.",
