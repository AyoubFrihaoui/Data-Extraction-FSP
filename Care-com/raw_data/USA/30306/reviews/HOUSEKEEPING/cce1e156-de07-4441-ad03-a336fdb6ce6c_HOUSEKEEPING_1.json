My youngest child recently got a driver’s license and I have 2 in college so I don’t need full time help any longer. Rena is hardworking, reliable, capable and a joy to be around. She helped me with all household duties, including general upkeep, laundry, ironing and organizational projects! She helped us move and did a phenomenal job organizing our new garage. She also was a tremendous help in setting up and taking down my fall and Christmas decorations. Rena also runs errands for me: dry cleaner, alterations, retail returns, pickup orders, mailing packages, taking my car to the car wash etc.  When I needed help transporting my kids, Rena also did drop offs and pickups for me. You would be truly lucky to have Rena helping out in your home!!",
