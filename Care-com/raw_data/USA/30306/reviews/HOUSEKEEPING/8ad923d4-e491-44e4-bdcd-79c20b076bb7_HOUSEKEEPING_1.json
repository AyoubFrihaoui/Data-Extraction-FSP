I cannot say enough positive things about Fotini.  She is a true role model and somebody that I will forever admire for her abundance of patience, joy of learning, discipline, and a desire to help those in need.  \r\nI work 12 hour night shifts and my husband's work hours were unpredictable - so we really needed a reliable adult who would teach, play, stick with schedules, etc.  \r\nWhen Fotini was with my kiddos, i knew that I did not have to worry.  And, although I tried to keep the house tidy, it was always a thousand times cleaner when I came home then when I left.  I trust her with anything and caring for anybody.  She is an open and honest communicator as far as expectations,  scheduling, or anything that might come up.",
