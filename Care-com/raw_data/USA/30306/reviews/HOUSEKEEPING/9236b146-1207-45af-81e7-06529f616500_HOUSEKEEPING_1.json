I lived, with my husband, in a 4,000 square foot flat with a dog and two cats (blue nose pit & two tabbies) and she was literally at my every beck and call. She literally helped me take care of my furry children and assisted me in keeping my home presentable. She would constantly go out of her way to make sure everything was in order as it should've been. She would be an asset to any family and I highly recommend her. The only reason why she no longer works for my family is because we are moving to another state. ",
