Patrice has been working for our family for three years as our full time nanny and now on a part time basis.   Patrice cared for our youngest daughter when she was three months while juggling our three year old.  When Patrice was full-time, she would be responsible for determining all meals for the girls, giving them a bath at night,  school pick ups and drop offs for my oldest, etc. She attended birthday parties, extracurricular activities, doctor's appointments, etc. Patrice cared for my daughters like she was their 2nd mom.  There's so much I can say about Patrice and how she kept our family afloat while we juggled a newborn, toddler, and shift work. I will be forever grateful!",
