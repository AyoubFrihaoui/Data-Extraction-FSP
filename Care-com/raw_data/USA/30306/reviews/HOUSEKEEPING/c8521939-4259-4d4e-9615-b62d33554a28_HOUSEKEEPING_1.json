When Lei was available and/or accepted a job offering, she arrived within a timely manner, excelled in abiding by the expectations of the position, and asked questions when needed. Due to extenuating circumstances, her availability shifted, so she was unable to perform several jobs offered. Lei's overall communication could use some improvement. I would consider hiring Lei again.",
