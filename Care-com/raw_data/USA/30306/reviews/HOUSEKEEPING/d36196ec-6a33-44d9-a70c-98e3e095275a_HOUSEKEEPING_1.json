            "displayText": "Keri joined our family when my eldest (now 7) was one year old.  She was able to nimbly adjust to two iterations of a family share schedule before joining us full-time after I had my third child in 2019.  She stayed with us throughout the COVID pandemic, which is the only way I was able to keep my job.  Keri worked with us for 6 years before moving to Georgia and became a real part of our family during that time. I was confident that she loved my kids and would always act in their best interest. She was able to get to know each one of my children and meet their individual needs and developmental level. She engaged them in a variety of fun, creative, and interesting activities, developing motor and language skills. I came to trust her input and advice when making decisions about the kids and knew that she would go out of her way to make sure they got everything they needed during the day. In addition to caring for them, the house was always clean and the dishes were done when I came home.",
