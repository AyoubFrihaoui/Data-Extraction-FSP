            "displayText": "Charlie is a world class nanny/baby sitter. This is my first child and I was very anxious in having another person look after my baby when my maternity leave ended. Charlie gave me peace of mind and listened very carefully to how to care for I. I could sense from day one that she was a natural at care-giving and had great intuition. Charlie handled even her most difficult leaps/growth spurts with ease; there were times when I. would fuss and not eat or she was very difficult to put down for a nap but Charlie knew exactly what to do. Charlie is also an excellent communicator; she was was great at keeping us informed of any significant milestones or issues that came up during the day. Charlie went above and beyond her childcare duties; she would clean common areas and keep things tidy without asking. It was very easy to trust Charlie with our child and to us that was invaluable. We will most certainly miss Charlie!!!",
