Emma called me and was able to enter the house using a keypad lock.  She found my mom delirious and unable to respond.  She stayed on the phone with me and called 911 from the house phone.  As EMT were loading my mom for transport to hospital,  Emma gathered up her medication list, ID, cell phone and charger, etc.  She followed the ambulance to the hospital and stayed with my mom until I arrived!  I live 2 1/2 hours away.  Emma stayed in touch to give me updates during my drive. Thankfully, mom was just dehydrated.\r\nEmma is kind, compassionate AND cool under pressure.\r\nShe went above-and-beyond in every way.\r\nThat was a heck of a first day of work!",
