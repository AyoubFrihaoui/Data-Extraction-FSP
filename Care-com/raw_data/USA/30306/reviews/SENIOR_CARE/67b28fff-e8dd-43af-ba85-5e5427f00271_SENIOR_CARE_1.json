            "originalText": "Alexandra was my mother’s caregiver for roughly 6 months. From the first phone interview I had with Alexandra, I knew she was special. I could tell from her dialogue that she was generous and kind, mindful and caring, She asked me as many questions as I asker her in an attempt to get to know my mother. Once she met my mother, I was confident that she was everything I thought she was, and Mom loved her too.\n\nMy mother’s memory and executive functioning were both declining so I needed help several times a week to check on her and help her with things. Alex not only did the things I recommended, but she took the initiative to do things that SHE felt necessary, based on her experience. She was also creative with coming up with things for them to do together. She was professional and patient, caring and empathetic, proactive and organized. She took such good care of my mother, and was always focused on her well-being. Alex also constantly communicated with me, giving me updates on their days together, and addressed concerns when necessary. \n\nI cannot say enough great things about Alexandra. When we finally had to move my mother into memory care assisted living, I was so sad to see Alex go. She had become an immense support system for me and our family. She is such a bright, loyal, dependable young woman. I would recommend her highly.",
