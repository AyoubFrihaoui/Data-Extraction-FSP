She took better care of all of them than we (their children) could have done.\r\nQuick list of words I often use to describe Hortensia as a caregiver:\r\namazing, smart, resourceful, reliable, dedicated, loving, caring, competent, responsible, respectful, attentive, patient, uncomplaining ... I'm sure I will think of more after I submit.\r\nMy MIL was in hospice 2x, and my mom was in rehab and later hospice. Every professional nurse, social worker, advisor who worked for the agencies told us that Hortensia is a GEM, and how fortunate we are to have her help. They were always confident  that the patient would get the best home care possible w/ Hortencia. Once Hortensia cares for someone you love, she is family for life. I cannot imagine not having her in our lives.",
