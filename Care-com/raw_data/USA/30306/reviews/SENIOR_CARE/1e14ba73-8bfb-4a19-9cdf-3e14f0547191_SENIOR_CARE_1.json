She is caring, capable and compassionate and she truly thought of my mother’s needs before I was able to. My mom doesn’t take to everyone but she was immediately thrilled to know Brie. They got along so well right from the start. Brie is also skilled at the art of taking safe care of your loved one. Once she was on board, I was able to stop worrying about my mother night and day. If you have the opportunity to work with Brie, she will surpass your expectations. Just fantastic! ",
