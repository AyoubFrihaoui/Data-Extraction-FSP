Punctual, dependable, professional, polite, kind, and patient. Ever so patient! I cannot begin to describe the patience she showed. Very willing to learn and extremely flexible. She even let us call her by a nickname because my MIL often couldn't remember her name.\r\n\r\nShe was a great help in taking my MIL to appointments and errands. She would help with food preparation as well as do the dishes and laundry. My MIL said that Kwaneysha is really good at folding and she loves the way she does it. Kwaneysha also helped with taking blood glucose readings and medications.\r\n\r\nI would not hesitate to hire Kwaneysha again. We were very pleased with her services.",
