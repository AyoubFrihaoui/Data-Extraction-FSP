            "displayText": "Connie has found her calling assisting seniors.  She worked with me and my wife during the pandemic in our home.  She's a great cook, compassionate, and is very honest.  She was able to easily adapt as my wife's moods changed and she is confident in dealing with Alzheimer's patients like my wife with dignity.\r\nI originally hired her to assist me in organizing.  I must admit I am a pack rat but Connie worked with me and never belittled me.  When the caregiver for my wife quit, I added extra hours until she became full time.  Connie shuttled my wife to appointments, took her shopping, and took her on outings like for haircuts or to get nails done.  I was especially grateful when she flew up to Buffalo with my wife.  When I return to Atlanta I would hire her in an instant again.  I wish you well Connie!",
