She was very quick to learn his needs, and very gentle and patient with him.    He really responded well to her.   She was very attentive to him.  She did all the extras for him that you want in a caregiver,  but had him work to maintain his own abilities too.  Her knowledge of exercise and PT was a plus for us.   She is very upbeat and a delight to work with.   I highly recommend her.  ",
