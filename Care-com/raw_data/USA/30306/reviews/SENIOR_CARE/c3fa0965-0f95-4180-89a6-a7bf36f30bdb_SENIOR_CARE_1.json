Mom's comments included how lovely and kind Barbara was to meet, workhorse that saw projects needing help and got them done (laundry, bathroom disorganization), and helped with food for future meals. Would love to have Barbara's help again.",

She even makes me laugh (which to me, is the best medicine).  There's nothing she won't do and always does it with a smile.  I highly recommend her for any of your caregiving needs.  I'm only 64 and the only issue I have is my back and my six month old goldendoodle puppy who is already 50 lbs.  I know she could more if it was needed by another client.  I can't recommend her highly enough.",
