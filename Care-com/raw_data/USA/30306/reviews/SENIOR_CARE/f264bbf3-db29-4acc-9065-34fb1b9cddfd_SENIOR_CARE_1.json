I don't live in the state and needed time sensitive errands to be completed in a specific order and she did an excellent job. It started off by me sending 3 people messages and she was the only one to respond. She let me know her availability and I gave her the tasks. She was punctual and very reliable and completed all task without any problems. If I need any help again, I am for sure using Jade. Thank you so much for putting my mind at ease. You are an Angel.",
