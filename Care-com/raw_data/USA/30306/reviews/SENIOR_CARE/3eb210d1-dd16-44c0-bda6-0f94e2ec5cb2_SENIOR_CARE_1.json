She extends herself and truly places my aunt's needs first.  She began being my aunt's caregiver  in approximately late November while she was still living in her home.  One of the first examples of Ambrosia's caring nature was when she invited my aunt to go to her family's home for Christmas day as my aunt lives by herself and there are no relatives living in Georgia. After I gained guardianship, it became clear that I needed to move my aunt into an assisted living situation.  Ambrosia was instrumental in assisting me with a multitude of details and still continues to go to the senior facility on a regular basis.  She has been a lifesaver!!  She has certainly earned this high recommendation.",
