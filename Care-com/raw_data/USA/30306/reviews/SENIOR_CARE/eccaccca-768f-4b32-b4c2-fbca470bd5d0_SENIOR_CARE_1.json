She is very considerate and will help whenever called upon. She is a nurturer and developer. She is always striving to do better for herself and to help others. She was a devoted daughter while she cared for her mother in her last years in her home. I highly recommend Marima for a care-giving role. She has a pleasant and positive attitude.",
