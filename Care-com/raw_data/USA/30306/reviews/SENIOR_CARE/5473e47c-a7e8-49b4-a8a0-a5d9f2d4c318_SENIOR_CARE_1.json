Was thankful and blessed to have them all work well together as a team because of Paulette's attention to detail. \r\n\r\nPaulette worked really hard and was available anytime I needed her. She became like family towards the end and took care of my friend as if she were her own family. \r\n\r\nShe is a kind, genuine, trustworthy and dependable person who would be an asset to any family. I have and will continue to recommend her to anyone in need of a wonderful caregiver!!!",
