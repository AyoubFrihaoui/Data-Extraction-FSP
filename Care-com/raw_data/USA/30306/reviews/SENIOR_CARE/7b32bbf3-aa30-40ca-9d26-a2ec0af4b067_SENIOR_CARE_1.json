He did an excellent job in administering physical and occupational therapies sessions, at home one-on-one basis regularly, which was prescribed by specialists of the North Side &amp; Emory Hospitals. He also provided transportation to and from the hospitals thrice a week for doctor appointments and therapy sessions. Through his continuous support and encouragement, I was able to achieve independent mobility at home which improved my quality of life 100 percent!\nMr. W. took care of activities of daily living such as meal preparation, medication, dish washing, bathing, laundry, shopping, and light housekeeping. He exceeded all my expectations. I could trust him not only with my credit cards but also with all my personal banking information. He is humble, committed and an excellent caregiver. I am extremely particular and get annoyed very easily but W. blended in and was extremely helpful in calming. He is equipped with the knowledge and skills to perform his duties in a professional manner. I do strongly recommend him for similar employment opportunities.\n\nBest Regards\nBob",

Wasi came in and we established a daily routine for my father's care.  He was not only a caregiver to my father but also a support network for my mother.  My parents trusted him completely.  He attended doctors' appointments assisting with getting my father in and out of the house which was cumbersome for my mother to manage on her own.  He came to our family with the qualities of a caregiver we were looking for; he understood the needs of my father, was trustworthy, provided exceptional quality care, was equipped with the necessary knowledge and caring skills to be a huge asset. Wasi was independent, committed, punctual, has a warm and friendly personality, including amazing communication skills. He did an amazing job to make my father's everyday life meaningful & enjoyable. He's an asset to whoever seeks his services, & I highly recommended him!",
