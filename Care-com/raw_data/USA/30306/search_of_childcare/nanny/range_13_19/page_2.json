I love animals, myself having rescued 3 cats and a guinea pig, lol! I love cooking, exploring, learning about new things, and creating memories! \n\nI'd describe my personality as broad-minded, energetic, and adaptable \n\nI like working with kids because it's fun to do. You take these little human beings, and everything you say or do to them shapes who they'll be as they grow. Adults are supposed to be their biggest supporters, their best teachers, and someone they can trust. We make their childhood, and I personally want them to look back when they're 30 and have their own kids and remember something I said to or did for them that impacted them in a good way.",
