I am new to Atlanta, reverently moved from Savannah, and am hoping to continue being a helping hand to families in the Midtown area. I have several years of experience as well as 2 younger siblings, whom I adore and have cared for full time during my time home. I am happy to work with children of all ages, pets of all kinds, as well as keeping up with daily housekeeping tasks. I am first aid trained, I do not smoke/vape, and my schedule is flexible. My ultimate goal is to foster a safe and uplifting environment for your little ones, and to be a positive role model in any and every way possible. I look forward to hearing from you to discuss how I can help! :)",

I've cared for children of all ages throughout college (from 4 months up to elementary age). I was a first grade teacher after graduating college, and then returned to nannying full-time during the pandemic.\n\nSince 2020, I worked with one family who now has 3 kids. At the time I started working with them, their second child was just a few months old. I've watched their children grow over the years and was there to welcome a new baby to the family. They're still a second family to me. \n\nI now work a full-time job in a different career path, but would like to find a great family to help on a part-time/occasional basis, mostly on weekends. I'm comfortable with anything you need, I can do cooking and cleaning/house chores in addition to entertaining the kids with educational/developmentally appropriate activities.",
