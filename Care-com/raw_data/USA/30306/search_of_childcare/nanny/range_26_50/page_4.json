As a patient, calm, creative, and friendly caregiver, I ensure your child will be in good hands. I have a college degree and am comfortable caring for children of all ages. I'm comfortable enforcing household rules and have experience with CPR and First Aid.\n\nI love to play outdoor sports, board games, and puzzles with children. I'm also happy to engage them in educational games that promote learning. To keep you informed, I provide verbal updates at pickup and regular updates via text or phone call.",

I currently work full time in higher education, but I continue to babysit because I love kids.\n\nI have 10+ years of experience with children in the classroom, childcare, camp, and nanny setting. I've babysat children from newborn to 15 years old for date nights and 12+ hour weekend day shifts. I nannied a family for 2 years, taking care of two sets of twins (3-year-olds and newborns). I tided the house, did laundry, and completed any other tasks needed to make life easier for the parents. I now have several families I babysit for on rotation in Atlanta. \n\nI believe in making a lasting impression on the families I work with by being reliable, maintaining open communication, and most importantly, building a relationship with the children. I am currently available on weekends and evenings. Please feel free to contact me with any questions!",
