I now have over 8 years of nanny experience from infants-children 13+. Since graduating, I have continued to nanny here in Atlanta while working in the robotics department at Scottish Rite until recently starting chiropractic school at Life University. In my previous nanny positions, I have taken on a multitude of roles that included taking care of the children obviously, but also tutoring, cooking, errand running, and small household/management duties. I am a very compassionate person with a love for kids and am willing to work with any family that has any particular or unique needs. My schedule is relatively flexible and varies by quarter- right now, my availability is in the afternoon. Life University is in the Marietta area, but I live in Midtown, so ideally would love to work with a family in that area.",

With a deep love for children, I truly enjoy creating a safe, fun, and engaging environment for children. \n\nI have a bachelor's degree in nutrition and a background in wellness, yoga, and sound healing , which allows me to bring a mindful and holistic approach to childcare. I love incorporating creative play and movement to help kids stay active and engaged. Plus, with my knowledge of nutrition, I'm happy to help prepare healthy snacks and meals that are both nutritious and kid-friendly. \n\nI'm an excellent communicator and believe in maintaining open and respectful dialogue with both parents and children. I'm also comfortable with enforcing house rules in a kind, yet firm manner ensuring consistency while creating a positive and structured environment. \n\nWhether it's playing games, helping with homework, or supporting daily routines, I'm committed to provide attentive and nurturing care.",
