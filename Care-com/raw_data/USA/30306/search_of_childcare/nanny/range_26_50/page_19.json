I've cared for people of various ages in a hospital setting, and in a private residence. I also teach swim lessons privately (ages 2+). I have enjoyed hanging out with and getting to know the kids I've watched. Seeing them learn and observe things has been so much fun over the years. From coloring, building forts and playing video games, to safe scooter races, taking walks, watching movies, or helping cover siblings up with construction paper, dull moments are rare when kids are around. I love being around young minds and learning from them! I am in the entertainment industry and could book a job with advanced notice, or in as little as 24 hrs.

Starting with my very own siblings (3 of them) at the age of 12 in Buford, GA, I would see us all off to school, along with keeping the house clean, cooking & managing all activities like soccer & cheerleading. In Woodbridge, VA I assisted with an at home daycare of about 10-12 kids. We fixed the kids breakfast, lunch & two snacks in between, went on field trips to places like parks, museums & the movies, held fun developing classes & activities plus more. My most recent children were cared for at my home; my sister in-law s two baby boys, ages 2 & 5. On & off; I guess you can say I m on call, providing childcare for my friends, family friends & friends of a friend. Cooking is not my specialty. My specialties are organization, fun, learning ideas/activities, and just the natural knack for kids.",
