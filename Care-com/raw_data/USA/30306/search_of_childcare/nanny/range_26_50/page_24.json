I was a stay at home mom for 12 years, and have directed childrens' ministries at churches, taught Pre-K, and am currently enjoying my role as a part-time mother's helper. I've also volunteered teaching Sunday School, and fostered dogs until adoption through Lifeline Animal Shelter. \n\nCurrently, I help run point for a busy family by meal prepping/cooking, organizing, tidying up, running errands, and helping them with their new pup. My goal is to see families be able to spend more time together and have less stress in their lives, and I would love to do that for your family, as well! I am organized, adaptable, warm, and hard-working. I enjoy meeting new people and their pets, and will give 100% to provide the best care for you and your family members. I look forward to speaking with you about your needs!",

I have over 20 years of experience working with kids, was a swim coach, and taught music lessons for 13+ years, and was a Youth and Children's choir director. I love arts and crafts, playing the piano, swimming and cooking. Atlanta has amazing weather and many beautiful parks to explore! I love to cook and am very tidy. I love to travel and speak some Italian and studied French, German, and Spanish. I am an avid reader and love to read expressively with children. There is always a lot of silliness, singing and pretend play! I am a gardener and will help foster a curiosity and love of nature in littles. Life is made of little adventures! \r\nI believe in a Gentle Parenting approach, working to meet the emotional and physical regulation needs of children; preferring to redirect and connect over strict discipline.",
