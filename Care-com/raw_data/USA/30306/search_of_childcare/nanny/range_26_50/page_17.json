Before that I spent my time volunteering at my church and a shelter for disabled women with children. I got into childcare in college working for the YMCA summer camp just to make some extra money and immediately fell in love. There was something about working with children with all their different needs, personalities and love that made me truly happy. Since then I've held different positions with the YMCA and The Boys and Girls Club, as well as two daycare centers as a teacher. I have worked with every age group from infants teens, all having their own challenges and joys. I am currently a teacher with Memphis Shelby County schools where I have taught 2nd grade for two years. I love education and finding ways to make it fun. Dancing, creating STEAM based projects, and learning new things with children is right up my alley. I look forward to helping a new family soon.",

Throughout college, I had numerous babysitting jobs and completed coursework to become a teacher. After I graduated I began nannying fulltime.\nI enjoy working with children and being a positive role model in their lives. I have experience with ages 4mo to 12yrs. I'm active, patient, reliable, easygoing, an excellent communicator, and can pick up on new routines quickly. Safety is my top priority. In past jobs I have driven kids to/from school and extracurriculars, meal prepped, helped with laundry, helped with homework, and put kids to bed at night. I'm also available to do occasional overnight sitting if that's ever a need. I am a career nanny with a passion for what I do.",
