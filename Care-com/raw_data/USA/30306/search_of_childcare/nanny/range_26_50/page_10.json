Full time loving sitter for your family. 4+ years experience under my belt, along with CCI certifications, valid child abuse clearances, along with clean background and driving records. I enjoy working with children, it is so very rewarding. I have experience with newborns, toddlers, grade school and preteen children. I believe all children, despite age, need love, attention and structure, someone who will set rules and boundaries, but will also be a fun time and let them enjoy themselves! I also am EXTREMELY experienced in elder/hospice/companion care too! I work for JFCS and have had numerous cases. Ranging from elders who needed help with errands and companion care all the way up to those seeking more help with showering, toilwting, dressing, etc. I have a million sources and come highly recommended!",
