Whether teaching in the classroom, caring for children as a nanny, spending beach time with nieces & nephews, or accompanying a family on their vacations, the best times in my life are filled with children. Snuggling babies, rocking toddlers while kissing boo-boos, playing outside and coloring with preschoolers, playing board games with school-aged children, and discussing life with young teens are many of the ways I interact with the children I care for from day to day. I am in awe of the way children's brains develop and love to find new ways to challenge them individually. \n\nMy experience includes 2 years of being a Full Time Nanny. Before that I have 8 years in the classroom with children from 6 to 9 years of age. I have a passion for Montessori education and have spent 3 of my 8 years of experience in a Montessori classroom.",

I previously held three long-term jobs, which included two part-time nannying jobs for families in my neighborhood, helping with homework and house chores. For three summers in a row, I nannied for a young girl, who was three when I first started. I took her to the zoo, the aquarium, different museums, and to various other places for fun activities. Throughout college, I would often come home for weekends or breaks in order to babysit for different children, in fact, there are many families that I babysit for regularly. I don't have a strict schedule, and I am very flexible with times and days. I am also capable of working on the weekend if something were to come up, or if you just need a night away from the kids.",

I am a student majoring in nutrition. I need a part-time job to help with school finances and I think babysitting would be a great job for me. I enjoy working with children and I love the outdoors and activities. I have a very reliable car and I am willing to run errands, clean, or cook. I hope I can be a great help to a wonderful family!",
