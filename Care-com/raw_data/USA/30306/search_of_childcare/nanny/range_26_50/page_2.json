I graduated nursing school in 2020 from the University of West Georgia. Before becoming a Registered Nurse I worked as a Certified Nursing Assistant , a nanny on care. com and also as a teacher assistant/tutor at Carrollton Elementary and Middle School. I'm currently in school at Troy University to become a Family Nurse Practitioner, which is why I am looking to work on care. com part-time while I'm in school. I'm certified in CPR, ACLS, and NIHSS. I have experience with infusions, TPN, G tube, NG-tubes, spectrum disorders, etc through nursing of course. I can provide my resume once interviewed. My priority is to make sure I am the perfect fit for your family and to give excellent care. I love working with children and the elderly. This is my passion and the reason I will be practicing family medicine in the near future! Please let me know if you have any questions!",

I have 14 years of childcare experience from newborns to 17 years old. I've worked as a nanny, babysitter, camp counselor, private swim instructor, theatre teacher and volunteer in special education programs (specifically ASD). My theatre background helps provide a fun, creative and safe space for children to learn and grow. It's a privilege to help kids learn to be themselves and be good people, and learn from them in return. I'm looking for work that is able to be flexible on few rare occasions. I am juggling a day job and a theatre career with means a lot to me. Thank you, hope to hear from you soon!",
