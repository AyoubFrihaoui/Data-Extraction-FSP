I currently work full time for ESPN, but would love to help families during my offseason and downtime with child care.\n\nThroughout high school and college I worked at a daycare- teaching/reading & creating a positive and fun environment for kids aged 1-5. On the side, I babysat for a family with newborn twins for a few years. \n\nI am very active & like to incorporate that in my childcare as well. Whether that's playing soccer in the front yard, helping a 1-year-old climb the stairs (with my assistance of course), or simply dancing to some Miss Rachel in the living room. Always a blast under my supervision!\n\nOne thing you should know about me is I have a ton of tattoos. I feel like this can come as a shock to some people when first seeing me. Absolutely none of them are offensive or distasteful! And no, no neck or face! But I know some families are not open to having their child exposed to this kind of self expression/art.",

I am moving to Atlanta the first week of January 2021 and am seeking a full-time nannying position. I am an experienced caretaker who has nannied for five different families at different points in my life. I have worked with ages 0-16 and am very skilled at what I do. My goal as a nanny is to be an integral part of the children's development. It is important to me that I form a close relationship with the family unit. I always make it known that I am willing to run any errands that make a parent's life easier. I am extremely self-sufficient and confident that I am an asset. Additionally, I am a very proficient cook who enjoys providing healthy meals all throughout the day. I often like to get the kids involved and make it fun! I am pretty creative when it comes to other activities as well. Thank you for the consideration and feel free to reach out with any questions!",
