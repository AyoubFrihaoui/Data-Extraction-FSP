I have worked with children ages 3 weeks to 11 years old. I was an assistant teacher at a daycare in a toddler room, but I was a nanny for a baby girl and I was with her since she was 3 weeks old. I was a part time nanny for a family with a 5 & 7-year-old. I've also nannied for a wonderful family with a wonderful little boy & a beautiful baby girl for 3 years full time. I do arts & crafts with the children, feed them, potty train, and also reading to them is a major thing to me. I'm ok with doing light housework also. I am CPR and first aid qualified! \n\nI left the last family I nannied for in 2015 & pursued a career in aviation. I was a flight attendant for 9 years but recently resigned because I realized my heart is truly with working with children and watching them grow. That truly brings so much joy into my life and I missed it so much!",

I started by watching my younger brothers and sisters and then began babysitting kids in our neighborhood. Over the last few years, I've interned with Northside Hospital, Grady Hospital, and Morehouse School of Medicine shadowing OBGYN's along with a plethora of other doctors. I love kids of all ages that's what makes it fun! If it's nice out, I like to take the kids outside, but if not, I whip out my creative skills :) Implementing new ways of understanding a curriculum is my sweet suit because not only does it tend to make assignments more understandable, it also makes homework a lot easier for the kids. I also love discovering their unique personalities. I am always mindful, with respect, that I take my responsibility to you and yours very seriously. Kids are simply my favorite to be around!",
