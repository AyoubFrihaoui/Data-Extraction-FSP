I am currently majoring in Economics with a minor in Management and Organization at Spelman College and will be residing in the West End area for the school year. I am an eager and enthusiastic babysitter. I am a proud big sister to my 5-year-old brother. I have over 5 years of experience working directly in childcare (all ages), including nannying for a family with a newborn and a 2-year-old. I also volunteer with middle school students during the academic year as a tutor. In these positions, I have learned that patience, problem-solving skills, and reliability are my strengths when it comes to childcare.
