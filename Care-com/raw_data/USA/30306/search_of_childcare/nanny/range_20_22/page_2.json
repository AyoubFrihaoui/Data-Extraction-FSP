I have extensive experience with children of all ages, from newborns and toddlers to young kids. A little about me - I recently graduated from Physician Assistant school and will be starting a full-time position as an Emergency Medicine PA-C in May. I recently relocated to the Atlanta area and am looking for nannying or babysitting opportunities during my downtime before beginning work. My background includes both medical and childcare experience. During PA school, I worked at Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital on the Trauma/General Surgery team and in a Pediatric ER. Before that, I spent a year as a nanny for two wonderful families. \n\nSpending time with kids is truly one of my favorite things - I love their energy, curiosity, and the joy they bring to the world! I enjoy planning outdoor activities whenever possible, but also love cozy storytime on cooler days. Let me know how I can help your family!",
