I obtained my Associate's degree in Early Childhood Education, my Bachelor's in Sociology, a Master's in Sociology with an Emphasis in Education, and an EdS in Teaching and Learning. I have extensive child care experience working with children of all ages. I enjoy educational TV shows and games, cooking, arts and crafts, and amusement parks. Reading is my favorite fundamental hobby. Children's cognitive, social, physical, and emotional development are the stocks and bonds of my business. I help children build their foundation of knowledge, one lesson at a time. With time, love, and support, I pay the price for instilling morals and values in young children. Parents and guardians, allow me to lay out the blueprint for your child's growth through nurturing, building a positive relationship, and a sense of trust.",

With five years of experience, I focus on creating a safe, fun, and nurturing environment where children feel comfortable to explore and develop.\n\nI believe in open communication with parents, so I always provide updates and share highlights of their child's day at pickup. I also make sure to follow household rules to keep a consistent routine.\n\nSome of my favorite activities with kids include outdoor sports, physical games, board games, and puzzles. I'm certified in First Aid and CPR, and I'm happy to help with carpooling and travel. Plus, I speak both English and Spanish, which allows me to connect with a diverse range of families.\n\nAt the end of the day, my priority is making sure your child is happy, safe, and thriving.
