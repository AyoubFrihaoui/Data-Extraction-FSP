I'm back finishing my degree, continuing my education to be either a therapist or a school counselor. I have 10+ years of experience working with children of all ages. In addition to years of being a nanny, I've previously worked for the Cobb County School District as an After School Program teacher and as a camp counselor for the foster youth through a non-profit. I am also currently a part-time substitute teacher in Cobb County. My hobbies consist of yoga, skateboarding, healthy eating, arts & crafts, playing sports, and so much more. My inner child shines brightly, which makes connecting with children come naturally. I love meeting new people and building connections with every family I work with. Since I am a full time student, I am available for part time work, and random gigs. Let's connect. I look forward to hearing from you!",

I remember how excited they seemed to stay with us.. genuinely excited. They talked to us, not at us. They were excited to take us to new places (even if it was just the flea market) At night, they turned our video games into dance tournaments and pasta into low country boil. Their attitude was contagious and that is the kind of teacher and nanny I strive to be! \n\nI currently work in the pediatric feeding department at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta and am available nights and weekends.",

I love to be engaging with children and refrain from too much electronics. Simple things such as going to the park, getting ice cream or arts and crafts is more mind stimulating for a child versus television all day. I also own a decor business so I am all about DIY projects and arts and crafts! I also own a cat and work well with animals. People tend to tell me I can brighten up their day with my smile and energy, and that I'm also easy to talk to! I do my own reliable transportation.
