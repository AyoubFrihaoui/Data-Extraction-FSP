I currently work at an early childhood development school, but I'm excited to return to private care to offer more personalized, thoughtful support. I'm CPR and Health & Safety certified and well-versed in caring for children at all stages of development.\n\nI bring a warm, nurturing, and playful presence while balancing kindness with gentle structure. I truly believe in creating a safe, loving environment where children can thrive. I love sparking curiosity through arts, reading, and exploring nature, and I'm happy to collaborate on a developmentally appropriate plan tailored to your child's unique needs.\n\nIn addition to childcare, I also offer light housekeeping and meal preparation if needed. Thank you so much for your time and consideration - I'd be honored to support your family and care for your little one!\n\nWarmly,\nKyrie",

I have worked part time teaching undergraduate juniors/seniors in Microbiology for the past 3 years. I received my BS from Wake Forest University as a student athlete, and received an MS from the University of South Florida. I have cared for all ages over the summers during all of high school, occasionally throughout college, and more consistently over the past year. I also watch my newborn nephew here in atl. I enjoy doing everything from being active outside to playing games inside to working on homework with kids (I especially love all things science). In my free time I like reading, health and fitness, and being outside! I have an SUV for safe transport as needed. I'm always on time, clean, organized, and give 110% to everything I do!\n\nI work from ~ 9-5 p.m.  on weekdays, so occasional nights or weekends would be ideal!",
