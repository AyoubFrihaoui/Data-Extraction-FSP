After I graduated high school, I lived in Champaign, IL for two years earning my Associate of Arts Degree in Psychology at Parkland College. Then I finished with my Bachelor of Arts Degree in Psychology at Flagler College, in St. Augustine, FL. I also spent time living in Los Angeles and St. Louis. In all of my moves I have had the pleasure of working for multiple families and two home daycares. Now, I am living in Atlanta, GA! I've been here about 6 months now, so I'm kinda new, but it's been great exploring what the city has to offer. I am seeking a wonderful family who is looking for the perfect nanny to care for their kiddos! Child care is a passion of mine and every new family holds a special place in my heart!",
