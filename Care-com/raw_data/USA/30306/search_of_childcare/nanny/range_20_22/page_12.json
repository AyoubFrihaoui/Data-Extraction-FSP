I love incorporating developmentally appropriate activities, music and movement, and mindfulness into my care to keep kids learning and growing.\n\nAs a mom to a toddler, I know how important it is to find someone you can trust completely. I strive to be the nanny I would hire for my own child-nurturing, dependable, and full of creative energy.\n\nIf you're looking for someone who will treat your children with love, care, and enthusiasm, I'd love to connect with your family!\n\nPlease message me and I'll be sure to respond.\n\nThanks,\nMyrriah",

I enjoy focusing on playing with toys and reading, taking walks with kids, going to the park, and enjoying time outside. I often bring crafts and activities with me to make it special when a babysitter comes. I am comfortable with all basic necessity tasks such feeding, bathing, diapering, and putting to bed.
