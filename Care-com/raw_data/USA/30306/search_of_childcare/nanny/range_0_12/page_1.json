I live in Poncey-Highlands and am hoping to find a family within an approximately 15 mile commute. \n\nI have a college degree, years of childcare experience, and am currently working toward an updated CPR/First aid certification. I have the most experience with littles (0-5yrs), but feel confident caring for children of any age. I'm a positive, friendly person who can get along with just about anyone. I pride myself on my patience and ability to calmly handle any situation. It is important to me that your children will not only be physically safe, but also feel emotionally safe, secure, and supported. I am not the nanny that will stick your kids in front of a screen all day - I enjoy playing, activities, and being outdoors!\n\nI look forward to speaking with you and meeting the needs of your family!",

I hope to help your children feel comfortable and loved rather than like a stranger is watching them. I have had CPR training several times but that has since expired and I do not hold a current certification. I have done many behavioral and parenting trainings throughout my time working in child welfare.\n\nI love to travel and worked in Germany for a year through the US Department of State Fulbright program so I speak a bit of German.

My last two summers as a college student, I worked as a summer camp counselor. I counseled children ages 7- high school. I am about to graduate college this May with a degree in Secondary Education and having completed a student teaching internship teaching Music to various grades and high school History. I am very passionate about working and investing in kids of all ages! \nI am looking for summer employment, and would absolutely enjoy the opportunity to continue working with children.

I was a girl scout when I was in grade school, where I took courses about the tasks and responsibilities of babysitting. It taught me about first aid, what to do in emergency scenarios, as well as how to make the best experience for the children. In high school, I worked at my church with children aged 4-11 and helped them with different musical activities, crafts, and overall just had fun! I love working with children and have a real passion for all things music and art, which is why I'm in school studying to become a preschool music teacher. I am also a personal aide for a young woman with muscular dystrophy and have 2 years experience taking care of her throughout the week. I look forward to potentially working with you and your family in the future. :)",
