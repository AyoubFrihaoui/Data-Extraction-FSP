I have over 5 years of experience as a nanny and have been babysitting for 14 years. I have experience taking care of children of all ages- from infant to 13 years old.\r\n\r\nAs a caregiver, I am committed to providing a safe, nurturing environment to the children in my care. I am also able to help with household work and errands as needed.\r\n\r\nI am a career professional, currently in between roles, so I am looking for part-time employment. I am able to do after school drop offs, pick ups, transportation to activities, and more.
