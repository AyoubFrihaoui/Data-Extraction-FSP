I enjoy doing Art, Hiking, and gardening have had many years of experience working with children, but in the last two years I have worked in the service industry while I was attending school at Georgia State University. In Georgia State University I studied Public Policy with a minor in Sociology.\n\nI have had a lot of experience working with kids age ranging from newborn to 14-year-olds. I also worked for two years as a coach for special Olympics with participants ages ranging from 14-25 years old. I feel I can do a great job of caring but also entertaining kids - whether it be working on art projects or hanging out at the park! I enjoy finding creative ways to keep the kids occupied, but also feel comfortable with keeping a good structure/routine. I feel confident in helping with homework.\n\nI have my own transportation, and I'm looking for a part time nanny job, preferably sharing shifts with another nanny.",

After the family moved away, I continued to hold babysitting jobs. During my senior year of high school, I participated in a tutoring program. Through this program, I was paired with a third-grade girl and would meet with her three times a week to help with homework and making sure she was staying on a positive scholastic path. After graduating high school, I moved to New York City. I worked in an elementary school with kindergarten-fourth grade students. I held after-school homework help sessions, I planned and hosted the schools field days, created and hosted the schools Drama Club and did one-on-one tutoring sessions during the school day with students who needed individual attention. After completing this, I moved back home to Georgia where I became a full-time nanny. I cared for three boys, ages 12, 9 and 5 during the day and three girls, ages 7, 5 and 2 during the afternoon/night. I'm an energetic, loving and responsible caregiver who truly loves working with children.",

I'm a full time digital marketing specialist and am looking for a position on the side to supplement my income. I am very capable and love taking care of little ones and spending time with kids. I love getting to know them and using my skills to the best of my ability to take care of them. I worked at a preschool in the St. Louis, MO for two and a half years. I don't see taking care of kids as a chore, but as something that I really love doing! I am trustworthy and flexible, and I have a great sense of humor so difficult situations do not stress me out. If you're interested, please contact me here or by giving me a call or text message. I am also open to regular date night babysitting gigs to help supplement my income currently.",
