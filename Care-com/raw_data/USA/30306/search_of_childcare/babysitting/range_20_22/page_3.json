A friend referred her to us and noted her childhood development and childcare experience which we preferred our nanny have. Over the months we had Rianna in our home we watched our baby girl learn new things daily.  Rianna provided interactive play and a safe space for our little girl. She taught our baby sign language which was completely unexpected but amazing. We now have a 17 month old who has a vocabulary of over 150 clearly spoken words. Rianna definitely helped establish that knowledge. She also helped guide us in knowing appropriate developmental milestones. \n\nIn terms of our working relationship, Rianna was friendly and social. She tidied up after herself and the baby. She was willing to help in anyway we requested and was cautious of the food allergies we live with. She communicates well with parents and family. She is extremely reliable and was always on time. \n\nWe were so sad to see Rianna go but our baby started daycare shortly after Rianna graduated. That being said, Rianna stays in touch and has visited since moving away. Our baby still looks at her picture and says “Anna” regularly. We are so happy to have had Rianna in our home. She made a huge impact in our lives as first time parents and in our baby’s development. \n",

I have been working with kids from a young age. Caring for siblings and cousins, which has made me extremely comfortable with babies and toddlers. I've worked at daycares and after school programs. I also have no problem engaging with older children. I feel that being in my 20s allows me to connect well with our younger generations. I do drive my own car, am comfortable with pets, and have my CPR/First Aid Certification. In addition to childcare, I can assist with housekeeping, homework, and family meal prep. I love taking kids to the park or interactive environments (with permission) to encourage fun and creativity. I believe in being highly adaptable, communicative, and passionate about creating a safe and creative space. Looking forward to hearing from you soon!",

She was integral in getting our schedules organized, a feat with four children. Originally, when we onboarded her, we had 2 school age children with various sports and activities. We were surprised with twins and that is when Kiana really shined. She is quick to jump into action and we realized she was meeting needs before we knew they were there. That coupled with her pleasant and professional demeanor is what led to her promotion. Kiana is great with children of all ages, and we were sad to see her go but very proud of her. We still use many of the implementations Kiana brought to our household, and we take every opportunity to see her when our schedules overlap. In addition to bringing balance into our homes, Kiana has become a part of the family. ",
