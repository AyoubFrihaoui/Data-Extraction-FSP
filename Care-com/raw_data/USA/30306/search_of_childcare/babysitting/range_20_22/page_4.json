In high school, I took early childhood education courses and received CPR, First Aid, and AED training.\n\nBeyond formal experience, I've provided childcare for families, caring for children ages 2-7, and I volunteer as a children's teacher at my church. I'm patient, caring, and adventurous, and I love engaging kids in learning and exploration.\n\nI'm looking for a job that offers trust, respect, flexibility, and communication. I'm a recent KSU graduate in finance and accounting, finishing up an internship while seeking full-time work. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, baking, traveling, and reading.\n\nMy skills include attentiveness, engagement, and responsibility.\n\nLet's connect!",

I am a graduate of the University of Georgia and am looking for babysitting and tutoring opportunities before I start rotations for medical school. I have been babysitting for outside families since I was 13, but I have been babysitting my twin younger siblings since I was 12. I have experience with children from ages newborn to age 15. Back in Athens, I worked at the YMCA as a child watch worker and dance/cheer coach. I also taught 6th, 7th and 8th graders in Columbus, GA at Baker Middle School, in addition to subbing at a variety of elementary, middle and high schools; I have plenty of experience with children! I love playing games and helping children with their homework. Creativity is my forte, and I always think of fun and educational ways to keep children entertained! I also love dogs, and I'm very comfortable around them. I'm also available to do light cleaning as well and look forward to interacting with you guys!",
