I would watch kids in my neighborhood when parents went to work or they just wanted a night out. \n\nIn my spare time, I like to shop, play piano, play with dogs, video games or watch tv\n\nOne thing you should know about me is I will treat your child like my own/ little sibling.

I have been a full time nanny since the end of 2019 but that is not where my childcare experience starts. All throughout high school if I wasn't at school or working I was picking up weekend sitter jobs for a few families in my town. In addition, I also had a best friend who had 12 siblings and 21 nieces and nephews who I would also frequently take care of. I possess experience with children ranging from newborn all the way through age 14. As for my medical safety qualifications I am CPR and First Aid certified. My end goal is to continue to actively enhance the lives of those in my community I have the opportunity of crossing paths with. Given the opportunity I would love to be a part of you and your child's life. To help , love, guide, and care for your little ones on this part of their journey.
