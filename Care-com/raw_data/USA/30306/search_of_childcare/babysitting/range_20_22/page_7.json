I learned a lot about teaching children problem solving, critical thinking, and creative thinking at this job. After that, I became a full time nanny to my nephew from the time he was born until he was 2 years old, only stopping since I moved away to college. I experienced everything from diaper changing, burping, bath time, tummy-time, rice cereal, walking, crawling... all the phases! While in college, I volunteered at two different church nurseries every Sunday, sometimes newborn room and some in the toddler room as well. This taught me about keeping young children's attention during lessons and how to navigate caring for multiple children at once. As a now college graduate, I know that COVID-19 has been hard on everyone, but especially parents. I would love to ease that burden by providing full time child care.",

Originally from Chicago (living in 3+ overseas countries before 18) & the oldest of four, keeping up with all ages is something I genuinely enjoy. I became a full time nanny yr of college & moved to Atlanta after graduating with a Bachelor's in Child Psychology. I feel i'm too young to have kids right now, hence why I love being a nanny! \nI use a Montessori approach to childcare as I find it is the best way to foster independence, self-autonomy & critical thinking. I love fostering natural curiosity & intuition of children through child-led days to shape learning/play based activities. I strive to give children a safe space to think freely and critically. \n\n+ 10 yrs experience as a sitter.\n+ 6 yrs experience as a nanny to children ages 2months-14 years.\n+ 3 yrs experience as a camp counselor.\n+ 3 yrs experience tutoring up-to 5th grade.\n+ Re-certified in CPR & AED- May 2023 \nReferences available upon request, please reach out with any questions!",

My communication style with parents involves verbal updates at pickup, regular text or phone call updates, and following their preferred communication method. I am very comfortable enforcing household rules and ensuring a structured environment for the children in my care.\n\nI enjoy engaging children in various activities, including music, creative arts, cooking, and baking.
