I learn as much from them as they learn from me. I love teaching and tutoring--I've worked as a teacher/tutor at an aftercare program in Atlanta (Horizons in Inman Park) and have also tutored college-level students. I've taken care of kids from infant age to about 12.\n\nIn my spare time, I like to read. I grew up in Montreal speaking French and try to stay practiced in it. I love writing creatively and playing guitar. Currently pursuing an MFA in poetry.\n\nIf you need English/French/Social Studies tutoring as well as or instead of traditional childcare, I'm your person!\n\nI have a car so can travel to you/do errands etc.",

I would make dinner for them, make sure their homework was done, and get them to bed. Usually, I would stay overnight because their dad was away for work. \n\nI graduated school as a Chiropractor, and have just moved back to Georgia. My office is not ready yet so I'm hoping to meet nice families and take care of some kiddos in the meantime (: \n\nThank you for considering me! Can't wait to meet you!",

The way in which they see and understand the world is always enlightening. They are also always fun, even amidst the chaos that ultimately are children.\n\nI'm looking for a job that has me either caring for children or tutoring them. Not particularly picky on the gig nor the children I would work with.\n\nI started working with kids when I was in middle school working in the nursery at church.\n\nIn my spare time, I like to crochet, read, go on walks to be outside, and watch TV\n\nOne thing you should know about me is I have been certified and trained to work with children in churches and was an interim director of Children's Ministries for 6 months. I'm also working on being ordained in the UMC. \n\nMy skills include communicating with children, planning activities, and teaching",

I have worked with over 15 families--from assisting for an occasional night out, to keeping children while parents went abroad, to traveling to and living with an Australian family. I not only love teaching and encouraging children, but I enjoy learning from them and seeing things through their eyes. To be wise and maintain a childlike innocence is truly a gem.",
