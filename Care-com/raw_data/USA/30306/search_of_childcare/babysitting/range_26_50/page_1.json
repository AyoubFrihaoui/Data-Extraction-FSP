I'm originally from New Hampshire, and after attending Kenyon College and living in Providence, RI, I moved to Atlanta to attend Candler School of Theology in 2018. I spent some time in the environmental justice nonprofit world, and am now following my lifelong passion for music as I grow my new business as an instrument teacher. I love nurturing confidence and creativity in my music students, and would love to do the same as a supporting member of your household! Very experienced caring for kids 1 and up, and happy to assist with housekeeping and pet care as well as childcare. Thanks for your consideration, and I look forward to seeing if I'm the right fit for your family.",

I'd love to be able to be outdoors often and even have the opportunity to cook for them.\n\nI started working with kids when my first nephew was born, I was around 15 years old. Shortly after that is when I had my first nannying job for my mothers bosses. My sister had 3 kids after my first nephew was born and I became a regular babysitter/nanny for them. Years later, I spent time nannying in New York City.\n\nOne thing about me is I'm very family oriented. Their happiness helped me find my passion in life, and that is taking care of others.\n\nMy skills include patience, understanding of emotional/physical and social needs, and creativity/ability to have fun!",

I have completed my pediatrics and emergency medicine classes so I am more than prepared for anything that comes my way. I have a 6-year-old nephew and 4 year niece that are big parts of my life. So I have experience with newborns and infants! I have been babysitting/nannying since I was 14, so I have experience with many different children and families, and am comfortable in many situations. Throughout the summer time in high school and college, I worked at a summer camp for children ages 2-12. During those summers I also taught children how to swim, so I am very comfortable taking your kids to the pool if that is something you are comfortable with. I am happy to send you any of my references, and look forward to hearing from you!",
