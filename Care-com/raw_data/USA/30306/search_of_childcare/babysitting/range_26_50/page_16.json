I love to cook and bake and I find it very fun to teach that to kids! I am an Honor student so I can help with homework and read to the little ones as well. I attend school Online so I have a pretty free schedule. Over the last few years, I've worked primarily with infants and toddlers, but I love kids of all ages. I like to take the kids outside, as I love spending time outdoors. In my free time, I love cooking/baking, reading, and running!",

I spent a year as an au pair in Spain, where I took care of a family with two amazing kids (2 and 7). It taught me a lot about keeping kids safe, happy, and entertained. \n\nI also worked for years as a flight attendant which made me fully First Aid certified for both kids and adults. We received a 5 day First Aid training every 18 months.\n\nAs the oldest sibling and grew up taking care of my younger sister and 3 younger cousins. During my summer breaks I worked with kids in summer camps. We came up with numerous activities to ensure everyone had a great time. \n\nI'm fluent in English, Czech and I am intermediate in Spanish. I also play the piano and the guitar and I will be more than happy to teach your kids! \n\nI look forward to bringing my experience and love for kids to your family. Let's chat soon!",

I believe that from early childhood to adulthood, everyone is unique regardless of their backgrounds, upbringings, or socioeconomic status. Individuals should be taught at a young age that they can sprout to be anything that they strive to be. If they couple that with hard-work and perseverance; success is in their future.",
