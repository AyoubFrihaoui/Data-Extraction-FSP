With over 20 years of commitment to childcare, supporting children through their developmental journey is my life's passion. My journey in childcare began as a dual-degree certified educator in Georgia, specializing in special needs (across all exceptionalities) and art. The majority of my experience lies in working with toddlers to preschool-aged children and preteens, but my care has also extended to infants and children with a variety of special needs. I have taught children with special needs for over 20 years within the public school system, covering ages from preschool to high school, with a predominant focus on elementary and middle school grades. I have been certified three times in CPR and the administration of emergency care for choking, minor injuries, and specific conditions like seizure management.",

She is completely trustworthy--we provided her with a credit card and she was careful to keep receipts for all expenses.

In addition to always showing up on time and never needing to be reminded of the routine, she grew a strong bond with my daughter quickly. She was playful when it was time, but stern when necessary too. She taught my daughter many words, gestures, and tantrum coping mechanisms like breathing/counting. She has a heart for taking care of little ones and never let me down. Now that my family is moving away, I wish I could pack her in my suitcase and take her with me.",
