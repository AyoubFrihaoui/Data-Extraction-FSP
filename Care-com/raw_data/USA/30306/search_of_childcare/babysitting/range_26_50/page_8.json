I've been CPR and First Aid certified and I also have experience with special needs. I'm originally from MS and I've been caring for children since I was about 11 years old. I've always enjoyed caring for kids of all ages, because they all give me a different experience/point of view. I'm very crafty and involve music with a lot of things. I also like taking trips around town to find different fun events to attend, or even just going to the park to play. Out of all the things l've done growing up, watching kids has always been my favorite. It fills me with joy to spend time with and learn the interesting personalities of little ones. I'm very outgoing with a bubbly yet casual personality. I hope I'm a great fit for you and your loved ones.",

I love being around kids! It is so much fun how many ideas they have about the world and how fast their little imaginations work! I have worked consistently for a family and worked birthday parties, family outings/vacations. I did a temporary overnight nanny position for four children from the ages 5-13. They were wonderful and it was a great experience getting them ready for bed cooking dinner/breakfast, helping with homework, taking them swimming, going to the park! Most recently, I nannied for a 3-year-old and 4-month-old 4 days a week, with some overnight care (sleep training, baby food prep and feeding, household errands, laundry, cleaning up)",

To say I love working with & caring for children would be an understatement. I wake up every morning with the sole intention of growing these kids into smart-minded, happy, & playful individuals. I work well with both boys & girls, have a tendency to be very silly/active while remaining professional in serious situations. I'm also CPR & choking certified with proof for infants, children, & adults. I currently live in Midtown but am willing to commute as far as Alpharetta. I believe communication with parents is key & also take my job very seriously. I will always make sure your child is comfortable, entertained, and safe. My rates start at $25/hr for 1 child & +$5/hr for each additional child. I look forward to hearing from you soon & can't wait to meet your little ones :)",

Upon arrival to college, I joined multiple on-campus organizations that were rooted in or had a capacity to work positively with children both at Vanderbilt's Hospital and locally in Nashville, as well as conducted research promoting positive intervention models for children and adolescents with mental illness(es). During my summer time off, I volunteered at Saint Augustine Youth Services as a mentor for young boys.

I have several years of experience working with children of all ages, from 3-month-old babies to teenagers. This experience has allowed me to develop skills to support children's learning, development, and fun.\n\nI am a dynamic, energetic, and caring person. I love creating a safe and stimulating environment for children, using games, stories, and songs as learning tools. I am also CPR and First Aid certified because safety is my priority.\n\nMy native language is Spanish, and while I am improving my English, this has never been a barrier to providing excellent care. In fact, many families appreciate this opportunity for their children to be naturally exposed to Spanish, promoting bilingualism from an early age.\n\nIf you are looking for someone committed, patient, and with an educational approach to childcare, I would love to be part of your child's growth and well-being!",
