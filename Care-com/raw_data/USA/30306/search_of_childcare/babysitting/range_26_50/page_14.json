I'm known for being patient, responsible, and empathetic, always prioritizing children's safety and well-being.\n\nI love outdoor games and encourage children to explore and learn through play.\n\nMy native language is Spanish, and while I'm continually improving my English, this has never been a barrier to providing the best care. In fact, I see it as a unique opportunity for children to be naturally exposed to a second language, enhancing their cognitive and language skills.\n\nMy priority is to create a warm and enriching environment where your child feels happy, safe, and supported.

I have worked with children of all ages, from newborns to teenagers! I have experience with multiples, children with medical needs, children with behavioral needs, and children with disabilities! My background and passion for education mean I prioritize developmentally appropriate goals and activities. My experience is very broad, you name it, I've likely done it! \n\nMy spouse and I have two dogs that we absolutely spoil! I love the outdoors, you can catch me hiking, swimming, or camping in my free time. I come from a BIG family so am very accustomed to organized chaos! I've been told that I come across as a very calm and collected person with a positive attitude. I strive to have a problem-solving mindset and am constantly thinking about the behavior I want to model for kids.",

Before graduating high school, I nannied, tutored and fed dinner to three children: age 4, 10 and 14, for several years before I went to college. There I completed several education courses. Alongside college, I also worked at a nearby church as a Nursery care giver for 0 to 4 years olds. Then I graduated in 2013. A few years later I worked as administrator and pet sitter for Distinctive Petsitting, before getting into other administrative positions.\n\nIn my spare time, I like to make crafts. I do a large variety of crafts. I've done sewing, glass mosaics, candle making, pottery, gardening and whatever else I can try. \n\nOne thing you should know about me is I believe childcare is one of the most important things and can be the hardest as well.",

She has been consistently on time, responsible, and reliable.  She has engaged my son in learning - colors, numbers, words, days, months, and Spanish. No joke within 1 week, Ms Marva had the 9-month-old falling asleep and staying asleep in her crib, which had been a struggle - she is a baby whisperer.\nThe best part? Ms Marva likes to have fun - singing, dancing, reading books, being silly, playing games.  Incorporating fun is so important for my kids - and she keeps up with the wild 3-year-old. Ms Marva is like family and has become an important figure in our lives.  I trust her very much. I'm happy to recommend Ms Marva without any reservation.",
