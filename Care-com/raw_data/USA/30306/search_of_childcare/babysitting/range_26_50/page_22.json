I have a Bachelor's degree in Social Work with a concentration in Early Childhood Development. I have experience caring for children of all ages (newborn - 10+ years old), and I find such joy in creating a caring environment that is safe, healthy, nurturing, and fun. I believe in the gentle parenting philosophy, and I love helping children learn through their natural interests such as exploring nature, arts, cooking, and building just to name a few. \n\nWhen I am not supporting families I am usually taking a walk and enjoying some sun, or trying new recipes in the kitchen.\n\nProviding childcare for the past 8 years has been a wonderful experience! I've been honored to support many families and children , and I look forward to continuing this journey and creating new experiences with the next family that I am paired with.",

Regarding household rules, I firmly believe in following the parents' lead, respecting their parenting style and expectations.\n\nWhen it comes to engaging with children, I enjoy a variety of games, from outdoor sports and physical games that encourage activity to board games and puzzles that stimulate their minds.",

No matter the case, I felt the urgency to protect, love and nourish these things. As I grew older, this carried over to my love for kids; like when I was younger, I felt the urgency to protect, love and nourish children. Not only do I feel this way about children from all ages, I get a genuine happiness out of them I truly love being around kids. For those reasons it makes it a so easy for me to work in childcare.\nI have extensive childcare experience, with children aged 0 to 13. From August 2022 to current time. I worked with children in various age groups, including infants 0-2, preschoolers 2-5, and school-aged kids 6-9. I have 1980 hours of infant care as a nursery teacher. From January to June 2024, I worked as an english teacher for ages 10 to 13, providing daily care and education.",

I sing and act with children. If you need a sitter that will engage with the children with puppet shows, songs, crafts, and cooking fun I am definitely the person for the job. I am also a certified tutor to math, reading, science, english, and computer courses. I taught summer reading courses, former substitute teacher and a youth volunteer. In addition to the mentioned skills I am a trained singer/ voice coach. I am open to doing light house work and cooking. I hosted a cooking show during my years as a college undergraduate and working on a children's educational pilot. A background check is available and I'd love to help with your needs!",
