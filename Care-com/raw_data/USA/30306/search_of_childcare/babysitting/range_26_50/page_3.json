I have worked with children ranging from newborn to 15 including special needs. When they help make their food, garden, or have fun eating their lunch it is easy to create healthy eating habits at any age. It is important to incorporate art, music, science, language, food, nature, and creativity into every aspect of learning. I strive to teach them why and how we do things. It is our job to nurture while educating so that they know how to be compassionate, self aware, socially adjusted, kind, and selfless adults. I facilitate their growth with teaching Spanish, exploration, nature, imagination, many types of physical activity, reading and adventure. I am CPR/First Aid certified. Every child has their own personality and needs so customize my approach. I can't wait to meet your little ones.",

During her time with us, our kids didn't just get older - they really grew as individuals. We had to say goodbye because our kids are now too old for a nanny, but Shina's impact will last their whole lives.

Starting when I was a teenager, I worked with daycare, after-school programs, and occasional babysitting jobs. As I've gotten older, I've directed and counseled at outdoors-centered summer camps. Most recently, I nannied for a year+ for a family with 4 children, 7 and younger.\n\nI'm a jack of all trades (I know a little bit about a lot of stuff!), and am a quick learner. The family I last cared for required tasks ranging from childcare (of course), to house management, cooking, and more. I very much consider myself part of the family team, so I'm happy to assist wherever I'm needed!\n\nMy personal interests include gardening, cooking, music, and photography. I also speak intermediate French, so if your kids need any help with their language homework, I'm happy to assist! I adore kids (and pets!) of all ages, and would love to get to know your family and help however I can!",
