I have one goal and that is to keep a smile on the kids and parents faces that I provide my services too. Every family that I have worked for has been at least for 3+ and currently still will babysit for them when they need services. I assist with homework, fun activities, doctor visits, school pick ups, snack, light house work, and errands. I am currently working for an awesome family who relocating to another state , so unfortunately I am seeking new employment.",

I have experience with kids from all ages including newborns.\n\nI am a very calm, patient, polite, caring and loving person! I consider myself a good driver and I have a clean record. I am also CPR/First Aid certified and fully vaccinated. I can also provide references anytime if needed.\n\nI love creating a connection with kids, see their milestones, teach them new things and help with their development. \n\nUnderstanding the parents/kids needs, affection, safety and respect are my priorities.\n\nI also have experience as house manager, doing groceries, laundry, cooking meals and organizing stuff.\n\nI am looking forward in hearing back from you and getting to know more about your family!",

She loved on him like he was her own and did awesome age-appropriate activities with him - even gave me suggestions on things to have at home for his activity time.  She was extremely punctual and flexible even when I suddenly would need to work extended hours in a given day.  She was such a genuinely kind and caring person and it was so incredibly hard on her last day with us.  She was such a blessing to our family. I would highly recommend Jessica.  She never called in sick, ways ALWAYS early and was just amazing with our child.  I love how she interacted with our baby and how much she helped us.",
