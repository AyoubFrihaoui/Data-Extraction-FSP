Over the past three years, I have gained valuable experience working with children through various summer jobs at different schools, as well as babysitting for family and friends. I enjoy working with kids because of their energy, curiosity, and ability to bring joy to any situation. Helping them learn, grow, and feel supported has been incredibly rewarding and has strengthened my ability to be patient, nurturing, and adaptable. My passion for nursing continues to grow, and I am particularly interested in pursuing a career as a labor and delivery nurse or an ER nurse, where I can make a meaningful impact in high-pressure, life-changing moments. Known for being empathetic, hardworking, and reliable, I am committed to providing the best care possible to those in need.",

As a devoted mother of four, I am deeply passionate about providing reliable and nurturing childcare to support families. I am well-equipped to care for children ranging from newborns to preteens, In addition to childcare, I am experienced in enforcing household rules and am also comfortable caring for pets personally, I have two cats of my own. I prioritize clear and open communication with parents, always following their preferred method to ensure they are kept informed about their child's day. When it comes to activities, I enjoy engaging children with outdoor sports, fun science experiments, and educational games that foster learning. As a bilingual speaker of English and French, I also enjoy incorporating language lessons into playtime to enrich their experience. Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me. I look forward to the opportunity to meet you and your family soon!",
