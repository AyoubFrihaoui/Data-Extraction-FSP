I'm a calming, positive, and creative childcare provider with 15 years of experience as a teaching artist for children of all ages, with a background in drama education. I've taught education classes, worked with children aged 3-17 in arts-based programs, and spent a year as a nanny for two toddlers, starting when they were 13 and 15 months old.\n\nI love working with kids because they bring out my inner child and spark my creativity. It's incredibly rewarding to play a role in their formative years, helping them learn, grow, and explore the world.\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy hiking, reading, and spending time with my fiancée and our calico cat. As a theatre artist with a Bachelor's and Master's of Fine Arts in acting, I bring imagination, empathy, and communication skills to my work.\n\nMy strengths include creative play, patience, and safety awareness. I'm seeking a flexible and rewarding role where I can continue making a positive impact on children and their families.",

Currently, I am concluding my position in Charlotte, after 5 years to move to Atlanta in early July. My passion is working with children and having the ability to watch them grow.

My experience spans caring for newborns to 12-year-olds, and I am fluent in both English and Spanish. I have often been described as very well-organized, incredibly kind, and empathetic. Growing up with so many siblings has blessed me with the ability to love deeply and understand the diverse needs of children.

I'm the eldest of six siblings, and I've had the pleasure of caring for them from birth. As a caregiver, I'm patient, creative, and friendly. very comfortable enforcing household rules. I do have a 15-month (1 )as well that I bring along with me. I have no problem bringing him as we do not want him in daycare this young. It is NO problem bringing him , kids usually love him and so do the parents. including my child. I Believe in open and honest communication with parents, and I'm happy to provide verbal updates via text or phone call, whichever the parents prefer. I love playing fun games with children. I am MORE than capable of caring for up to two children, including my child. I am currently in college for medical billing & coding and medical assistance,  I'm comfortable with pets but not cats as I am highly allergic.",
