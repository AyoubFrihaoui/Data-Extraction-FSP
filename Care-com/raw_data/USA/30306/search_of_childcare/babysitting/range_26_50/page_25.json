I am 22-year-old, born in Atlanta and raised in the Middle East, therefore I speak two languages. bilingual With over 4 years of experience caring for children from newborns to 13 years old, I'm passionate about nurturing and engaging kids. I love arts and crafts, and as an athlete, I prioritize sports and outdoor activities over screen time. I emphasize good manners and education, assist with homework, and help with housekeeping. I'm also a reliable helping hand to parents, willing to take on errands or any tasks to lighten your load. I'm dedicated to keeping your children active, entertained, and well-cared for.

I also have experience working with children and adults who have intellectual disabilities and/or physical limitations. I am responsible, patient, kind, and best of all... fun! I like to use the four Ms when caring for children: movement, music, the magic of learning, and making sure your kids are safe.

I like to have fun with the kids I'm taking care of which could include anything from taking them to the park or if it's rainy finding arts and crafts to do. I am good with pets and can help out with things that need to get done around the house as well. I have lived in Atlanta my whole life so I know all the ins and outs of the city and how to navigate with ease. Since working with many different families I have learned how to be flexible and adapt to all different children and ages.",

To give an overview, I began my journey working in a preschool for three years while I was in high school beginning in 2015. I made small lesson plans, handled snack time and made sure the kids had a productive/fun day. Then, I began nannying my freshman year of college while obtaining my bachelor's degree. I've watched babies beginning at the age of four months through teens. I'm positive, patient, attentive and I enjoy highlighting the little things, allowing kids to make the most of their childhood! I'm currently looking for a long term position while I'm in school furthering my education. I am not comfortable with pets, please let me know if you have any that aren't on your profile!

My patient and friendly demeanor helps me build strong relationships with the kids in my care and their parents. I believe in open and honest communication, so I follow the communication method preferred by the parents to discuss their child's day and any matters that arise.\n\nAs a caregiver, I'm comfortable enforcing household rules to ensure a safe and structured environment. My ECE training and coursework in early child development, combined with my First Aid and CPR training, have prepared me to provide a high standard of care.\n\nI enjoy playing outdoor sports and physical games with children, as well as educational games that promote learning. I'm comfortable caring for one child at a time and am open to helping with carpooling, light housekeeping, travel, and swimming supervision.\n\nI'm a non-smoker and comfortable with pets.",

As much as I would love for children to learn from me, I can learn from them just as much. My main goal when it comes to take care of children is protection. That goes for mentally, physically, and emotionally. I would be honored to be apart of a child's upbringing. To watch them grow and become the person they are supposed to be. \n\nI'm looking for a job that keeps me on my feet. Children are a challenge that I am willing to take. Im looking for a job that allows me to be a mentor for others. \n\nI started working with kids when I was 15 years old. I became a lifeguard at the community center in Maryland, where im from. \n\nIn my spare time, I like to cook, read, watch television, do hair, and draw\n\nMy skills include patience, being creative, and communication",
