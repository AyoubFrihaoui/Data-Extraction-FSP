Growing up with younger siblings and cousins I gained much experience with children! Developed patience, alertness, responsibility, quick thinking skills, and resolutions. My father had a busy travel schedule when my sister was younger, this meant I had to stay home with her, make sure she was fed, safe, cleaned, and her homework was complete. I'm thankful for the opportunity to take care of my family at a young age because it taught me lessons and morals that I can take with me to this day. Rest assured with me your children will be safe, healthy, happy, and most importantly in great hands! Look forward to working with you!",

Over the past nine years, I have worked with families during pregnancy, birth, infancy, and early childhood. One of my greatest strengths is my ability to be flexible and adapt to each family's unique needs, routines, and parenting philosophies. I take pride in offering professional and nonjudgmental support. I believe in creating creative, safe, and fun spaces for children to explore and learn. I enjoy helping children cultivate their curiosity, understanding, confidence, kindness, and perspective of the world around them. Thank you for considering me.
