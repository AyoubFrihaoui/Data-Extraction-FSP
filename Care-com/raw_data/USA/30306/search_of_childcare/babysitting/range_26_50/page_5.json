I'm Covid/Flu vaccinated and got my Tdap booster. \nI have raised 4 great children of my own, (and rescue dogs and cat) and have been proactive in every stage of their development. 'Momming' is what I do best. I'm a native English speaker, but can have a basic baby conversation in several languages! I sing and do funny voices: Babies give me 2 thumbs up! \nTidying up and baby laundry are done while the baby is sleeping. I have my own dependable car, impeccable driving record, and infant-child CPR-First aid certification. I also love when there are pets at work! \nIf you're searching for a caregiver you can trust implicitly with your precious newborn, then please contact me. I have great references from my previous employers (4 doctors+), and currently focusing on newborns through 1 year. \nPlease be in touch!",

Now, I currently stay in Buckhead Georgia and major in business management.\n\nI was an infant teacher at the Goddard School until I discovered Nannying and fell in love. I simply love children and enjoy helping them learn & grow at every stage of their lives. My strengths as a nanny are that I am very responsible, reliable, and a caring person! I have cared for children as young as 6 weeks up to 8 years of age. I enjoy encouraging kids to be creative with activities such as painting, coloring, reading and exploring outside. I think it's important for children to try different activities and expand their horizons, and I love being apart of that! \nBeing a nanny has given me the opportunity to meet not only the kids but their families and their surroundings. Every kid I take care of is a new child experience I acquire, I look forward to meeting your family!!",
