I absolutely love children! I coached peewee cheer-leading for 3 years, which was very hands on with young children. I used to work for a non-profit organization called the Liberty Learning Foundation, that distributes a program to students from 2nd grade through 12th grade about civics, careers, financial responsibility, and how to be a good citizen. Now I work as an actress I just got back from Colorado performing in 3 professional Musical productions. \n\nI'm extremely hard-working, very dedicated and at the end of the day I love to have fun! With my Musical Theater background it ensures that I'm very creative, and would create a fun and safe environment for your child!",
