I primarily worked with children who are raised in the Montessori style of parenting and I carry some of the lessons and allow your child the freedom to feel their emotions.

She puts his health and safety first, but they also have a ton of fun together. As a first time mom, I get nervous with every new milestone he’s going through (eating, walking, etc.), but Shoshannia’s experience and calming spirit always puts my mind at ease. My baby is very active, so I was worried about finding a nanny who could help him sleep, but he sleeps even better with Shoshannia who encourages him to stick to routines. She goes beyond taking care of him to taking care of our family: helping clean dishes, clean our baby’s room and kitchen, bringing goodies to share, offering warm hugs, and so much more. We also appreciate how she speaks Spanish to our baby and is kind to our cats (who have felt out of place since the baby arrived.) Our boy lights up when she arrives; he kicks his legs and crawls right over to give her a big hug. I would highly recommend Shoshannia as a nanny if you need one!",
