I love to believe I have a very nurturing and fun personality. I've been around children as young as 3 months - 13 years old, since I was in elementary school. I started working in daycares and volunteering at schools in Las Vegas in 2018 and continued in the childcare field (nannying, daycares) in San Diego up until I moved to Atlanta in 2022. \nI love to cook new foods, go outdoors and simply just be apart of their growth development. Children are honestly just so fun to be around. They're so funny, honest, and just filled with so much curiosity about the world. \n\nIn my free time I enjoy markets, festivals, riding my long board and just relaxing at home. I currently reside in   Georgia but open to travel.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read about me. Hope to hear from you soon, take care.",

Hence, I love to do arts and crafts and think outside of the box to come up with fun games and activities to entertain children. Some of my favorite activities recently involve painting, drawing, and using recycled materials to create new toys. I believe it is essential from a very young age to expose and incentivize children to follow their imagination and use their imagination to solve problems and come up with solutions. This is something I would like to do with my host children from day one. Lastly, I also enjoy storytime - reading books and acting out stories, doing puzzles, playing with play dough, and doing outdoor activities like riding a bike, playing hide and seek, and going for walks.",
