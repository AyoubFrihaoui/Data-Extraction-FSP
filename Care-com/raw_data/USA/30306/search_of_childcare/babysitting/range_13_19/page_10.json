I believe in creating a safe and nurturing environment where children can learn, explore, and thrive. With my creativity and imagination, I find joy in engaging children in various activities that spark their curiosity and interests. Effective communication is important to me, so I provide written daily reports and have verbal communication during pickup, following the parents' preferred method of communication. As for enforcing household rules, I am comfortable to some extent.\n\nI have one year of experience as a childcare provider and am comfortable caring for up to three children. I hold a college degree and am certified in CPR and First Aid. I am also willing to help with carpooling, light housekeeping, travel, and swimming supervision.\n\nMy friendly and approachable personality allows me to build strong relationships with both children and families.",

I was an only child growing up and always longed for a younger sibling. I've been working with kids since I was 13 and was fully responsible for kids of all ages by 16. I've primarily worked with infants and toddlers, however with me getting older I've been enjoying conversing with older children as well. I love watching kids learn and would love to be a part of teaching them the beauty about the world. My favorite hobby is 'chasing the sunset', & I like to be outside as much as possible. If I am inside you'll usually find me in front of a mirror doing special effects make-up (yes, I can face paint!), or doing crafts in general. I previously was an admissions liaison for a drug and alcohol treatment center and while it was rewarding, I'm looking forward to a more light-hearted experience within my career. I look forward to speaking more in depth if you decide I could be a good fit!",

I am currently a medical assistant at a pediatric urgent care and a K-12 substitute teacher for APS. At both I've gained experience caring for kids of all ages, including newborns. I love caring for children because it is the most joyous and rewarding job ever! I take pride in creating a safe, fun, and nurturing environment. I love keeping kids engaged with creative activities like reading, outdoor play, and imaginative activities. When I'm not running around with little ones I enjoy staying active with hobbies like reading, working out, and spending time outdoors. If you're looking for a responsible, dependable, energetic sitter who can keep up with your little ones, I'd love to support your family!",
