As the oldest of 5 kids, with a 17 year age gap between myself and my youngest sister, I know a thing or two about taking care of children. I love kids endless curiosity, creativity, and ability to challenge someone to be the best possible version of their self they can be. I love to be outside and explore the natural world through a child's eyes, so with me you are guaranteed to be hearing facts about animals, rocks, and flowers from your little one once I am gone! I also speak some Spanish if language is a barrier. I have taught children in a summer camp-setting in the past, and am very comfortable assisting with homework and virtual learning, or even acting as a tutor if needed. I enjoy cooking, hiking, road trips, and making art in my free-time. Safety and health are incredibly important to me, and I can provide my negative Covid-19 results before entering your home.",
