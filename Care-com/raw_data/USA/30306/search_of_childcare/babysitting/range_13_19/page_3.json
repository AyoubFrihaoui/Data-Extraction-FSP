I live in the Tucker area and I am currently a student at Georgia State University, where I am majoring in Communications and minoring in Early Childhood Education. I've had a passion for working with children all my life. \n\nThroughout my experiences, I've had the opportunity to work with kids in various settings, including volunteering on a mission trip to Sudan, where I tutored and took care of multiple children. I also have experience tutoring, dog-sitting, and light housekeeping. Although I'm newer to working with children with autism, I'm eager to learn and would love to continue growing in that area.\nIn my free time, I enjoy reading, dancing, cooking, and baking, and I live an active lifestyle that includes spending time outdoors. I'm fluent in both Arabic and English, and I have my own reliable transportation with a clean driving record.",

My passion for fostering children's growth and development led me to a premed track in college. (working toward my BLS certification right now!)\n\nAs a patient, calm, and creative individual, I strive to create a safe and nurturing environment for children to learn and grow. I believe in open communication with parents and regularly provide updates on their child's day.\n\nMy approach to childcare aligns with the parents' rules and values, and I enjoy playing both educational and physical games with children. Whether it's outdoor sports or learning games, I'm always looking for ways to make learning fun.\n\nI'm fluent in English, Portuguese, and Spanish and am comfortable caring for multiple children at a time. I'm also happy to help with cooking, meal preparation, carpooling, and light housekeeping.\n\nI'm excited to bring my skills and experience to your family and help your child reach their full potential",
