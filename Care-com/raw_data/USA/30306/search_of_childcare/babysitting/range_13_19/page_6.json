Due to COVID-19, I will be attending school virtually this school year; therefore, I will be home and available all week. I am able to tutor and assist your child with anything school related, and provide safe care/supervision for your child(ren). As the oldest of 5 siblings, I naturally developed big sister nurturing skills. I have had years of experience watching after my siblings, ages 11, 13, 17 and twins that are 19. Over my lifetime I have mastered how to keep children on schedule/on-time, prepare meals, ensure safety at all times (being safety conscious), assist children with homework/tutoring children, keep children occupied (arts & crafts, playing outside, educational games), resolving conflicts, and provide emotional support/patience.",

I have 6+ years of nannying and babysitting experience, as well as two years of experience working in a daycare. I have worked with ages starting at three months all the way up to 12-year-olds and also have experience with special needs children. I am still a child at heart and love spending time with kids, playing outside, doing arts and crafts, games, etc. I am more than willing to help with any homework or online learning, transporting to and from school or extra curriculum activities, preparing food, cleaning, etc.",

I have had various babysitting/nannying jobs throughout high school and college and parents have always been very pleased and love how comfortable kids are with me. I have also worked at a summer camp where I led a group of 4, 5, and 6-year-olds. I love doing crafts and activities, but I also love to explore music with children as well! Not only will I make sure that your kids are always safe and comfortable, but I will also strive to have a great time with them with an enthusiastic and passionate attitude! I am currently nannying for a family that I have been with for about 2 years and am looking for part time in the afternoon/evenings after 4 p.m. on Monday and Fridays and after 5 p.m. Tuesday-Thursday. I am also available on weekends! I am available for one time or reoccurring positions. Let me know if you think I would be a good fit for your family!",

We have been incredibly lucky to have found such a gem of a person.\n\nAndrea has over 10 years of experience as a nanny, taking care of children of various ages. She is based in Stone Mountain, and is open to working with families across Atlanta. She is also available for evening and weekend babysitting as needed. \n\nDuring her time with us, Andrea created a fun and engaging environment for our son. She kept him entertained with music and stimulating activities. She also made sure he spent time on his tummy and sitting up with support. She listened to our directions and always shared her observations about new things our son was doing. We are grateful for the time we got to spend with Andrea.
