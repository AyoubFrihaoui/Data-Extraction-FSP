In this class children came to the high school every Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday and it was basically preschool for the children. I had a babysitting job for 9 months. I took care of an autistic child and a 10-year-old with ADHD. I more recently have taken care of a family with an infant. Now that was great. I learned so much from them they were wonderful kids. I occasionally cooked for them. I helped with homework and made sure they took showers before their parents got home. He was 3 months old It was the most wonderful experience ever! I changed his diaper, fed him, did tummy time with him. I took him outside with cat, for walks and more. I currently work full time as a community associate at Regus & part time at Allied Universal.

In this job, I was responsible for prepare the meals (breakfast, lunch and some snacks), drop-off and pick them up at school, go to the playground, help them with homework, drive them for sports and laundry once a week. My schedule was Monday - Friday, from 7:00 a.m.  to 6:00 p.m.  \n\nMy second job, I took care of 2 boys between 5 months old and 3 years old. My routine with them was just play with them, prepare some meals, laundry, go in some playgrounds and some creative activities. \n\nI also took care of a baby (overnight from 9 pm-7 am), she was only 10 days old when I started. It was an amazing experience. With her, since she was newborn, it was just trying to help the family during the night with bottles (formula), change diapers and etc. \n\nOf course, in both jobs, we like to go to the pool during the summer. I also like to practice some sports with them. I really like to go outside with them (when the weather is good) and read some books (I think it's important to encourage them). I loved to work with them. \n\nI am loving, caring and responsible person. I really like arts & crafts and I love to have fun with kids and help them as much as I can. So then we can have fun together!\n\nThank you for your attention. I hope to talk to you soon!",
