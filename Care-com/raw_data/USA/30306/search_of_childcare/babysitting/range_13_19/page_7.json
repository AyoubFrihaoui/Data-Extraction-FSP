I started babysitting when I was 12 and have been babysitting ever since for children ages 3 months - 11 years. I have also been a nanny for an infant. I was a world traveler at 19 and taught preschool in Eswatini and English classes to elementary schoolers in Guatemala. I just graduated from UGA with a bachelor's degree in Child Development and Family Science and I have a strong love for children. I currently run a church nursery so I spend a lot of time with kids ages 0-5. I would love to be a nanny for a family in Atlanta while I take some classes before I go to nursing school. I am a very fun and passionate person and would love to help out your family in any way that you need.",

I have experience with as young as 2-month-olds to teenagers.

Interacting with kids reminds me to see the world with wonder and have fun along the way. I bring patience, kindness, and a positive attitude. I can listen to kids talk endlessly about their interests, even when I don't fully understand. It's amazing to see how their minds work and how passionate they are about what they love. I also bring creativity and a willingness to make learning fun. Most importantly I ensure that each individual feels safe. :)",
