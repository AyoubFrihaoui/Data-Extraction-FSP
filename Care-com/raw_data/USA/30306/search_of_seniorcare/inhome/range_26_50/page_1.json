I graduated nursing school in 2020 from the University of West Georgia. Before becoming a Registered Nurse I worked as a Certified Nursing Assistant , a nanny on care. com for three lovely families, and also as a teacher assistant/tutor at Carrollton Elementary and Middle School. I'm currently in school at Troy University to become a Family Nurse Practitioner, which is why I am looking to work on care. com part-time while I'm in school.(I had to recreate my profile on here due to inactivity since becoming a nurse). I'm certified in CPR, ACLS, and NIHSS. My priority is to make sure I am the perfect fit for your family and to give excellent care. I love working with children and the elderly. This is my passion and the reason I will be practicing family medicine in the near future! Please let me know if you have any questions!",

I could tell from her dialogue that she was generous and kind, mindful and caring, She asked me as many questions as I asker her in an attempt to get to know my mother. Once she met my mother, I was confident that she was everything I thought she was, and Mom loved her too.\n\nMy mother’s memory and executive functioning were both declining so I needed help several times a week to check on her and help her with things. Alex not only did the things I recommended, but she took the initiative to do things that SHE felt necessary, based on her experience. She was also creative with coming up with things for them to do together. She was professional and patient, caring and empathetic, proactive and organized. She took such good care of my mother, and was always focused on her well-being. Alex also constantly communicated with me, giving me updates on their days together, and addressed concerns when necessary. \n\nI cannot say enough great things about Alexandra. When we finally had to move my mother into memory care assisted living, I was so sad to see Alex go. She had become an immense support system for me and our family. She is such a bright, loyal, dependable young woman. I would recommend her highly.",
