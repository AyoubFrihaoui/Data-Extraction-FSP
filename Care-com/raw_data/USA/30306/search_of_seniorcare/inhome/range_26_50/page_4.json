When I was younger I'd volunteer to take care of my older family members when needed. \n\nNot only was it rewarding to know I'm helping to improve their day to day lives, I always learn valuable lessons from them. And by caring for seniors, I'm also able to help their family members who may be having a hard time transitioning with aging relatives.\n\nI have experience working with the elderly in their homes as well as assisted living. I've taken care of senior with Alzheimers, dementia, as well as those with physical disabilities due to aging/illness.
