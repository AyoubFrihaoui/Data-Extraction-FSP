I can remember how sad I felt when I saw how poorly she was treated while in the hospital. That was the moment I decided I wanted to become a healthcare provider. I believe that everyone no matter their age, culture, race, or financial situation should be given the best care that could be offered. I wanted to be that person who made their day!\n\nI graduated high school with a certified nursing assistant certificate and started on my journey to becoming a part of the healthcare system. \n\nI would love to be of assistance to a family where they would feel comfortable knowing that they have entrusted the care of their family member to me. I know how unfair and unloving some people can be toward those who cannot help themselves. It isn't fair and I take it as a motivator to be better. My grandmother deserved the best care and in her memory I will provide the care she should've gotten to anyone I can.\n\nI hope to hear from you.\nElizabeth",
