I grew to share a special bond with their kids as well, and we still keep in touch. The nurses that come across me working are always amazed at how well I tend to my clients. Most were bed ridden up until the end and never experienced bed sores, or falls. People were always in awe of my love, and passion for my clients. I'm always smiling, loving, caring, kind, reliable, dependent, on time, and informative. You'll always get the real me and never a representative.

I previously assisted an adult family member with cerebral palsy and another recovering from a heart attack, by helping to schedule appointments, attend doctor's appointments, keeping paperwork and other affairs in order, being an advocate, when necessary.\n\nIn my spare time, I like to read, watch movies, crochet, etc.\n\nOne thing you should know about me is I have a wealth of skills and know how to get things done.\n\nMy top three senior skills are listening, helping, and problem solving.",
