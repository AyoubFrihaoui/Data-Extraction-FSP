During her finals years of life, she struggled heavily with her mobility and I was grateful for the opportunity to be present in assisting her with those challenges. I would encourage anyone needing the help to consider me (with reasonable training provided) and allow me the opportunity to hone in on my senior care skills. Thank you.",
