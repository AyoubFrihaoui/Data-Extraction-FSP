While working at those places I also established a cliental with patients that were treated for rehab and continued to help them recover once they returned home. I am a well rounded, hard working individual that loves working with the elderly & to be able to witness growth throughout their recovery. Some of the duties I offer are: compainionship, light housekeeeping, meal prep, daily vitals, distributing medication, basic ADLS & hospice care as needed. \nI enjoy working with seniors because I like being someone they can talk to, they can confide in just like if I were apart of their family.
