I have been working with the elderly for many years. I've worked in facilities, rehab, hospice, and also private care within my patients' homes. I love communicating with my patients and their families and forming healthy relationships with them. I enjoy doing various activities and being outside looking at nature. In all the cases I've worked, the patient loved me and I loved them. I enjoy working one-on-one therefore, I can meet their every need and more. I was taught to go beyond the expected and not just what you are required. Every patient is treated as I would want my elderly parents to be treated. Let's get you and your family properly taken care of.",
