I also understand a little Polish and Ukrainian. \n\nI have a bachelor's degree in Physical Therapy. \nBefore I moved to the US I used to work as Physical Therapist in a hospital in Prague, Czechia for almost 7 years. I have experience with inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation (after-surgical and post-injury rehabilitation, respiratory therapy, stability& balance training, etc.) \n\nBesides my professional skills, I can also help you with cooking, cleaning or pet sitting (I love all animals!). \n\nCurrently, I'm unemployed and have plenty of free time. I'm looking for opportunities to make some extra money until I find a stable job. \n\nI'm available every day for 2 hours, from morning (depending) until 7 p.m.  I have a car so I can arrive at any time will be needed.",
