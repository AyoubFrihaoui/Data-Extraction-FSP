And this too is the reason why I want and love to care for the elderly. I know how it is to be on the other side and wanting someone to truly care for you love one. I understand what it takes-patience, love, understanding, respect, honesty, and pride in what I do. Make sure the seniors I care for are comfortable and safe in their environment is key to me.",

For as little as a hour or for 24+, I have managed whole homes respecting all beings, including parents and fur babies; my services can include whole house management: coordinating care needs, scheduling maintenance, cleaning, cooking, errands, and coordinating with other household staff. I am creative, vibrant, and dynamic, with the ability to be playful yet assertive when the time calls. You will often find me with a smile on my face and a song in my heart seeking to share joy, but able to be sensitive to the ever changing feelings of those in my care and being willing and able to meet them there.",

I would feed, change and give her sponge baths, along with just being there to talk to her, pray over her and make her laugh. When she was released from the hospital several months later I cared for her around the clock as well. I really enjoy taking care of and spending time with senior citizens. They are very wise and although I know I give the best care I know how to give I feel so blessed to be around such individuals.
