It started off as a way to get out of class but as the years progressed I've fell in love with home care and assisting others. Helping someone in need of assistance always makes my day knowing I'm able to provide purpose in the world somewhere. \n\nI like caring for seniors because we all get older some day. Everyone ages so everyone deserves to feel comfortable no matter what stage of life they're in.",
