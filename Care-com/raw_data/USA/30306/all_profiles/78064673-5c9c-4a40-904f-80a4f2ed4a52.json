Learning about child development and the science behind child behavior has been a fascinating journey for me. My Bachelors degree in Behavioral Science from Mercy College and my experience as a mother have truly expanded my understanding of child psychology. \n\nAs your nanny, my mission is to keep your children safe, happy and stimulated by providing a nurturing environment and facilitating activities to foster their creative nature, individual interest and personality. Whether it's pretend play, singing, dancing, crafts, sports, nature exploration or science experiment. Also, as a native Spanish speaker and experienced Spanish tutor, I'll be thrilled to incorporate Spanish if you desire.",

I am very creative and skilled at prepping and planning very fun yet educative activities to help children practice and develop all of their Spanish skills in a very engaging way.
