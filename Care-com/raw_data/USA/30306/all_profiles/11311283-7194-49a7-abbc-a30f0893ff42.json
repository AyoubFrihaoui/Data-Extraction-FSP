I have most recently been working at Georgia Aquarium as an environmental educator. We work with students coming in on field trips, summer camps, and also do outreach in schools. This training has taught me to be very familiar with the Georgia science standards of excellence which we would base our curriculum off of. I am also trained in STEAM. My passion is teaching children about animals, science, and the outdoors. I also love arts and crafts and making learning as fun and engaging as possible. I am looking to continue this passion during this time of hardship for parents while their children are going to school at home. If you want a nanny or a sitter to simply be at home with your kids or you want to go above and beyond and use my knowledge and experience to tutor as well, I am available for either.",
