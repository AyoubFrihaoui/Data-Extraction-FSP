I love doing art with kids and just studied art and architecture in Europe for the last semester. I am currently getting a yoga teacher training certificate so love to teach kids about yoga and the power of mindfulness!\n\nI'd describe my personality as organized, kind, and cheerful!\n\nI like working with kids because they have a different perspective on the world. I love hearing about their thoughts and learning from them. I also find it super rewarding to see them grow as a people! \n\nI'm looking for a job that lets me get to know the kids and family. \n\nI started working with kids when I was 13. \n\nMy skills include baking/cooking, cleaning, crafting, and driving. I have First-Aid and CPR training but unfortunately have not been able to renew it this year.",

I love to apply my psychology knowledge to my studies to make my learning as efficient and effective as I can and would love to help others improve their study skills. I'm also super passionate about helping girls get into STEM. \n\nI'm looking for jobs that focus on science and math and that are recurring and fit into my schedule. \n\nI love chemistry because I see problems as little puzzles to solve. I also love personifying molecules to remember what they like to bond with. Math is a tool that we use frequently in chemistry, so I know a lot of math and problem solving.",
