My experience includes written daily reports and regular updates to parents via text or phone call.\n\nWhen it comes to play, I enjoy engaging children with board games, puzzles, and technology-based games and apps. I'm also a skilled swimmer and would love to teach your children how to swim, if you'd like!\n\nI hold a graduate degree and am certified in CPR and First Aid. I'm also fluent in English and Spanish.
