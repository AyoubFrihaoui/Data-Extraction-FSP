I enjoy playing outside with them. I'll make sure they'll be safe while having fun and learning at the same time. I do not mind short notice to babysit. I mostly been working in Jersey City (Port Liberte) and Hoboken. I worked at several daycare centers as well.\nI also love to do arts and crafts. I worked with many newborns and stood with them till they went to school, watching them grow up is a pleasure. One of my hobbies are swimming. I love kids and this is my passion and what I'm born to do. I'm a caregiver. DUE to everything that's going on at the moment I'm only looking for something temporary",

My area of expertise is newborn/infant care.(I have 5+ years of experience in NICU.)\nI'm patient, calm and I know how to create a fun and engaging atmosphere for children of all ages. I love playing outdoor games, board games, and puzzles with children, and I'm always looking for new and exciting ways to help them learn and grow.\nI understand the importance of communication and will always keep parents updated on their child's day. I'm also very comfortable enforcing household rules and routines, and I believe in working together with parents to create a consistent and positive environment for children.\n\nI'm certified in CPR and I'm a non-smoker.
