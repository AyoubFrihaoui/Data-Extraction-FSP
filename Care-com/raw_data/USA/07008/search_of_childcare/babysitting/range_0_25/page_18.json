I use to work for a single mom her daughter and I was with her after her surgery before I knew she needed a liver transplant, my duties were to make sure she takes her medicine every day morning and night. I had to make sure she was fed and had to take her baths. Overall they were so good to me and I was to them. I have references I could provide as well.
