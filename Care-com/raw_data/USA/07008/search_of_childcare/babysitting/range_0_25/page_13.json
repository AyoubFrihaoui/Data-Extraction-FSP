My last experiences have been taking care of a 3-month-old baby (now going on 5 years old), some of my tasks have been feeding the baby as directed, preparing food, changing his diaper and clothes playing with him, bathing him, lulling him, reading to him, playing tummy time or putting him in his crib when he needed it.\nAs he has been growing up my tasks have been changing, I have also taken care of his sister who is now 8 years old. On the other hand, my experiences with young children have been somewhat similar with the difference that some of my tasks have been to support them with their school projects.

I have been responsible for multiple children and children of all ages, and have spent years in working with the same families. I spent a year in working in an after-school program, and am working towards a Bachelor's Degree in Elementary Education. I have been trained in CPR and various other First Aid skills. \nI love reading, writing, music, and all kinds of art, and am very open to providing any kind of academic and/or creative support. \nI have always truly loved what I do. I have been lucky enough to work with children from every age group, and I also have some experience with children with special needs. Feel free to contact me with any further questions or for references.",

I often looked forward to chances of looking after my younger brother, as well as helping with friends and family. For the past four years, I have been babysitting, gaining valuable experience with children of all ages.\n\nI am CPR certified and a former lifeguard-- safety is always my top priority. As a current pre-medical student, I understand prioritizing health and well-being into my childcare approach. I strive to create a fun, engaging, and educational environment while maintaining open and consistent communication with parents.\n\nEvery family is unique, and I will happily adapt to different homes and parenting styles. Whether you need structured activities, help with homework, a drive to extra curriculars, or a play-based approach, I'm happy to meet those needs.\n\nFeel free to reach out-I look forward to connecting with you and your family!",
