I would like to start putting more funds towards paying off my student loan debt so working a part time job will be helpful. I graduated from the University of Miami in 2018 and since then, I have worked in the energy industry as a Project Engineer. Due to my career, I have sharp interpersonal, STEM, and communication skills. My experience is with 8-year-old and 13-year-old child care for 3 years. In addition, I have been a very active helping hand for my siblings by assisting in child care for my nieces/nephews. I have always loved the idea of working with children and being a positive, guiding element of someone's childhood. I believe through tutoring or a care position, I can do that. I am open to various opportunities so please feel free to reach out to me and ask any questions you would like. Looking forward to connecting!",

I am working on my masters degree and am a few months away from being a certified teacher. I have experience with coursework in early childhood development. I'm calm, friendly, and patient, and I prioritize clear communication with parents, updating them daily on their child's day and following their preferred communication method. I enjoy playing educational games that promote learning, as well as board games and puzzles. My skills include cooking, meal preparation, and light housekeeping. I'm happy to care for one child at a time, and I follow the household rules set by the parents. I hope to be the childcare provider for your family.",
