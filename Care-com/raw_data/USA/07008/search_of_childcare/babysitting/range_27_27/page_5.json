My daughter is at Wesleyan University playing lacrosse (proud mom) and my son is a senior in high school, committed to play lacrosse at St. Lawrence. I am also a former Westfield special education teacher and I provided early intervention for many years. I have been providing child care for newborns and up for over 15 years locally. In the last few years I have also taken on the role as house manager for several families. I have been fortunate to stay with the same families for years at a time and have the best working relationships with all of them. I am working part time now with 2 families so I only have part time hours available but can fill those with the right family. Feel free to contact me with your needs. Thanks!",

Some key take-aways for me were i) caring and nurturing, ii) communication, and iii) punctuality.  \n\nFirst of all, Imani was such a loving and caring nanny for our now 7-month son.  The amount of smiles that he had each and every day with Imani were priceless.  She did a great job not only learning his routines, but also all of the queues that change over time and as he developed in his own special way.  I sincerely hope to stay connected with Imani and to continue having her be a part of our son's life as he continues to grow.\n\nSecond, her communication was top tier.  For me with a work schedule, it was great to be able to communicate with Imani throughout the day with updates.  I know she also sent many intraday fun pictures to my wife with all of the activities, walks and smiles!\n\nFinally, her professionalism and punctuality.  With us having very active lives, having consistency, punctuality and flexibility is key.  This was table stakes, and Imani never caused us to question this for a single moment.\n\nImani was a gift, and I could not recommend her high enough.  She was a fantastic caregiver to our son, and a pleasure to work with from the parent perspective.",
