I have worked in environments where I would need to be aware of medication intake and distribute them if your loved one is on a schedule for prescribed medications. I'm very comfortable with all kinds of pets, I do love cats but unfortunately I am allergic that is a weakness for me. I can help with Light Housekeeping and crafts. If you have a pool have no fear I am an excellent swimmer / diver for over 10 years and I'm currently CPR certified. I'm very knowledgable in terms of what to do during a crisis.",
