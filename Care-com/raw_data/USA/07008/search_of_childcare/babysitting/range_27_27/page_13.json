I strive to provide a safe, nurturing, and stimulating environment for your little ones. I'm known for my patience, creativity, and friendly nature, making me an approachable caregiver for both children and parents.\n\nI believe in open and honest communication with parents. I provide regular updates on your child's day, whether it's through verbal communication at pickup, text messages, or phone calls. I respect the parents' preferred communication method and follow their lead when it comes to enforcing household rules. My favorite activities to engage in with children are educational games that foster learning. I am currently located in Union, NJ. I am a full time stay at home mom to my 10-month-old daughter. I am looking to work with local working families who need childcare services while they are away at work.",
