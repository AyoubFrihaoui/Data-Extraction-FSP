I have been so impressed by Yaira's approach, and how quickly my daughter got accustomed to her. It's also obvious to us that her learning and development has accelerated since Yaira started watching her. She ensures that the day is filled with a combination of reading, playing, outdoor time and creative activities. \nSecondly, she is a great help to us as parents. She has easily taken any instruction we've given, she is solution oriented, and always curious how she can be more helpful. Also, despite play and fun, the house is always spotless. ",

My passion for working with children stems from my positive experiences in previous babysitting roles, where I discovered my ability to make a positive impact on their lives. I enjoy supporting families and providing reliable childcare options that meet their needs.\n\nI believe in open communication with parents and provide regular updates on their child's day, either through verbal communication at pickup or via text or phone calls. I adapt my communication style based on the child's age and the parent's preferences.\n\nRegarding household rules, I prefer to follow the parents' lead and enforce the rules they have established at home. This ensures consistency and a smooth transition for the child.\n\nWhen it comes to playtime, I enjoy engaging children in educational games that promote learning and development. Board games and puzzles are some of our favorites.",
