Love above all because when you love children you simply take care of them as if they were yours and instinctively you protect them and give them the best of you. Followed by all the activities they have, their physical and personal development. I really like activities outside the home such as taking the children to parks, library, music classes, sports and also activities inside the house such as painting, art and craft, reading books, homework and many other things. Help with children's clothes and healthy meals. I hope to have the opportunity to find a new family with whom to start a new chapter of my life with a lot of love!",

I started off caring for my younger siblings until they were old enough to care for themselves. As the years progressed, I continued to care for the children within my family. Professionally, I began to working at a local daycare for approximately 2 and a half years, which is where I discovered my passion for caring for children. I've worked with children from the ages of 3 months to 12 years old, including children with special needs. My position was a \"teacher's aid/assistant.\" My main duties were to maintain classroom cleanliness, make sure all babies were changed/fed, engage in activities with all students, and enforce learning skills in the classrooms.",

I'd love to tell you a bit more about myself. \n\nI'm currently in university to achieve my bachelors degree in nursing. I live in Union NJ! Typical ages I've cared for ranges from 4-10. \n\nMy previous family I had two amazing boys, aged 4 & 10. Our weekly activities included basketball, gymnastics, and karate practices/games, homework help, bath time, and light meal prep (occasionally had to cook dinner). \n\nWilling to provide references, complete a background check, and interview asap. Please reach out if interested!",
