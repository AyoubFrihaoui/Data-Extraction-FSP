                    "experienceSummary": "Hi! My name is Kate and I am a New York City, Board of Ed Certified Substitute Teacher. I have a Bachelors of Science in Music and I have a very unique experience teaching that can be a great asset for your family this year. Not only have I been teaching private music lessons for about 20 years (both in person and remotely) but I have also been teaching children from ages 3-18 in some capacity or another for nearly 20 years. Other than a regular classroom setting where children are grouped by grade and age, I also have experience working with multiple children of varying ages and levels at the same time. Due to the Pandemic, I worked at a REC center this past Spring where each teacher had a classroom full of children of all different ages (K-5th grade). The combination of distance learning and the physical classroom gave me many unique tools to use so I can teach and enrich children's lives while keeping them safe and healthy.",

I would love to be your babysitter! \n\nI've been taking care of kids of all ages from the time I was 16 - infants, toddlers, pre-teens, and even teenagers. I started a virtual tutoring business during the pandemic that turned into a full-time in-person teaching position for 5 elementary school kids. I worked every day in person with my pod from 8-3 for four months - beyond tutoring, the experience made me a skilled caretaker and proved my ability to juggle and adapt to many different situations! \n\nI love animals of all types, being active, education, and cooking (see my chef instagram @chefdria if you're curious)! I play a few instruments as well, so if music is something you're interested in, I am more than happy to do some music lessons on the side too! \n\nPlease feel free to contact me directly or inquire for references etc. More than happy to speak further!",
