She prioritized socializing my younger son, creating a group of friends that he sees every day which was very important to us. I fully trust Mariana with both children's safety and know that she diligently watches them when they are out.

When it comes to childcare, there's so much stress, so it's nice when the person you hire doesn't add to that stress. One time I had her come watch my 2 boys while I tidied the house and ran some errands. I didn't have to explain or prompt her with what to do, like I have had to with other babysitters. She took charge, played with the boys, and they had the best time. We have recently moved. For awhile, we were back & forth between 2 states. We kept our dog in SI for a few weeks, and she was super helpful watching the dog, feeding, walking, etc. I really wish we had found her sooner. She always had a smile, there was never any drama, and the boys loved her. I should also mention that I have a 3 and 5 year old: 2 boys who are very rambunctious. The 5 year old has epilepsy. This is something that was a deterrent to many applicants. I told Liana about his epilepsy, medication, seizures, and what to do, during the interview. She felt confident that she could handle it. In addition, there were days she had to watch the boys from 5:30am-9 or 10pm, and she did so with no issues. I would hire her again in a heartbeat.",

I also do house work; such as clean, laundry, food preparation and pick ups and drops offs. My main purpose is to make life just a little bit easier for you. Anything I can do to make things easier, I am willing to do. I am willing to nanny at your home or at my place. Whichever you are comfortable with. I am looking for something full time and I am willing to provide references. I am COVID Vaccinated and I have the booster. I am CPR certified & have background in early childhood education. I have worked with children who have special needs & have worked with kids from ages 2 weeks to 19 years old! Hopefully I can be the right fit for your family.

My journey in caregiving began with fulfilling babysitting roles, where I discovered my natural ability to connect with children and positively impact their lives.\n\nMy patient, calm, and creative personality allows me to engage children in various activities that foster their imagination and development. I believe in open communication with parents and provide regular updates about their child's day, ensuring peace of mind.\n\nI'm comfortable enforcing household rules and have a knack for making learning enjoyable through educational games and outdoor activities. With a college degree and training in early child development, First Aid, and CPR, I'm well-equipped to handle any situation.\n\nI'm happy to assist with cooking, meal preparation, carpooling, light housekeeping, travel, and swimming supervision.",
