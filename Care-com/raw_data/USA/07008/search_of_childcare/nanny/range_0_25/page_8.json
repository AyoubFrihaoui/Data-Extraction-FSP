With three years of experience and some college education, I bring a blend of knowledge and practical skills to my role. My patient and calm demeanor, coupled with my creative and imaginative nature, allows me to connect with children on a deeper level. I believe in open communication with parents, providing regular updates about their child's day and promptly addressing any concerns that arise.\n\nI am very comfortable enforcing household rules, ensuring a safe and structured environment for children. From outdoor sports and physical games to board games and puzzles, I enjoy engaging children in various activities that foster their physical, cognitive, and social development. My commitment extends beyond childcare, as I am happy to assist with cooking, meal preparation, and light housekeeping tasks.",
