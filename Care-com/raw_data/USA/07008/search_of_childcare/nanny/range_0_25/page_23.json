I'm a toddler mom and I have experience effectively interacting with infants and educating toddlers working towards specific age-appropriate milestones. While also creating a fun and interactive environment planning activities that both entertained and stimulated the children. I also worked in 2 daycares where I created a safe and nurturing childcare environment for up to 15 children ranging from 3 months old to 4 years old collaborating with two other caregivers. While clearly communicating and coordinating with parents to understand each child's specific needs and desires. I maintained a clean environment by changing diapers daily, potty training dozens of children, and regularly sanitizing surfaces. \nI would love to hear more about your family and what you are looking for in a nanny. \n(I am also open to long term/short term/one time jobs.) \nI can't wait to hear from you :)",
