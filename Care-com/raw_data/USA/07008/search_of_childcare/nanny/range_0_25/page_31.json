Furthermore, I am former employee of a family entertainment company for over two years where I maintained and fun and safe space. I had a practicum as a school counseling student intern in Rahway public schools. I assisted in maintaining confidentiality, compassion, and assistance to insure that the students will be the best versions of themselves. I gained the capabilities of handling children no matter the age while giving them a worthwhile experience they talk about time and time again. I would love the opportunity to demonstrate. To conclude, I believe I have the capabilities, patience, spirit, and trustworthiness to be a support for the child's development.",

After some retail work, I went to college, pursued a degree in psychology, and then continued to nurture my love of children by working as a bus aide, a behavioral therapist for kids and teens with developmental disabilities, and then as a nanny for a family with two children. I love getting to know children and helping them to cultivate their intellect and creativity.
