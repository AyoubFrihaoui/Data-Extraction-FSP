I graduated college about 2 years ago, and currently work as a behavior technician for children with autism. I plan to go to nursing school in the spring, so I'm currently looking for babysitting jobs to help finance that, as well as offer my care and help to those who need it.\n\nI've always had a natural knack for working with children, and love to do it. I'm an energetic, caring, young at heart sitter, and love doing arts and craft, playing with dolls or blocks, or even helping with homework. I've had a plethora of jobs where I've worked with kids in different settings, including babysitting, swim lessons, substitute teaching, and ABA. I find immense gratification in working with the youth of our future, and find that kids love me for my fun and silly nature, while still being a responsible caregiver.\n\nI'm also fluent in Polish.\n\nOnly one-time or occasional jobs please.\nAvailable after 5 p.m. Mon-Thurs, after 2 p.m. Frida",
