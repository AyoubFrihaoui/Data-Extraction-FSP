Prior to my last 2 full-time jobs, I was a full/time nanny for mainly 2 families for 3 years and always did one-time sitting sporadically. While I was a full-time nanny, I was with children ages\n0-12 and responsibilities included meal prep, driving to school/extra curricular activities, any home routines that they needed done, etc.\nI am fluent in both English and Spanish and I also know ASL which not fluent just yet but learning with time as I have a HOH nephew! \nI'm currently in college for Social Work and as mentioned have a full-time job but looking for any part-time or date-night sits.\nPlease feel free to reach out and ask any questions.\nI look forward to hearing from you!",

Children are the joy of my life , I am currently studying child psychology, so working with children is just another step into furthering my career. I am the oldest of five children, so responsibility is nothing new to me , I have helped raise my siblings from birth until now. I do have a car and never even a speeding or parking ticket on my record. I enjoy children very much , at all ages including babies. I currently go to University. I take my career very serious and believe this would give me great experience and a good opportunity.",
