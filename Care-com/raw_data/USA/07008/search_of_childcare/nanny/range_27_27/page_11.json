Growing up as the second of four siblings, I naturally took on the role of caring for my younger siblings. From helping with assignments and playing games to ensuring their well-being, every aspect of caretaking brings me fulfillment.\n\nMy patient, creative, and friendly personality allows me to connect easily with children. I believe in open communication with parents and prefer to discuss any issues at the end of the day to minimize worries. However, in urgent situations, parents would be notified immediately.\n\nI am very comfortable enforcing household rules and enjoy playing both educational games that promote learning and outdoor physical activities. With a college degree, First Aid Training, and CPR Training, I am well-equipped to handle various situations.",
