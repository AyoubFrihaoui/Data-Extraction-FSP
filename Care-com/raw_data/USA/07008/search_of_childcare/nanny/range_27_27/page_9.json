The woman had offered her $5 an hour and Stacy politely recommended hiring an aupair. Stacy has been taking care of my boy(8) and girl(3) on and off when my husband and I need her. She has been amazing and our kids call her aunt Stacy and miss her so dearly when she leaves. We took the whole family to Key West for her wedding and her husband joins us for dinner occasionally. Stacy is ALWAYS the first person I call when I need help with the kids, we have an ongoing conversation over text as well because she’s part of our family now. I can’t wait for her to have kids of her own, she will be a great mother.",
