I hired her to help me during a major surgery and difficult recovery. I hired her in advance of the surgery, and confirmed with her several times that she would be available to help during and after my surgery (I have 3 young kids and I cannot walk). I paid her very well, was very flexible when she needed to leave early to take care of her own kids, and I gave her a very generous tip of $200 for Christmas. And then right before my surgery on a day she was supposed to clean she sent me a text message saying she wasn't coming anymore - no warning, no help finding a replacement. And she kept the $200. I believe this woman is a manipulator and possibly a thief. I should have never let her in my home. Please be warned.",
