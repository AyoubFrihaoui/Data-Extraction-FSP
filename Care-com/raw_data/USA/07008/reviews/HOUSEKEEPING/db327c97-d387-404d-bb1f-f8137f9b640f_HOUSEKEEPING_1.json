            "displayText": "Corinne has done an outstanding job as a home educator for our family. She is a consummate professional, who loves children and teaching. Her commitment, dedication and love of our twin daughters has helped them develop, thrive and grow while in the pandemic. She helped our daughter who was attending a hybrid option with her virtual classes and lessons in addition to creating her own lessons to supplement her classroom work. Both of our daughters have special needs and Corinne has experience in this area. She was also willing and eager to attend their virtual therapy sessions, in order learn about things that would help improve them develop. She has made numerous suggestions to my husband and I regarding supplemental aids to purchase to assist the girls development, which we have acted upon. She has transformed one room into a mini classroom, which has been priceless. We are grateful for the compassion and care she has displayed for our children and family. We highly recommend her!!",
