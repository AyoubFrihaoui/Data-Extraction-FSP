She said she would inform me the next day as early as possible once the results were in as she was certain she would be negative and would be at my home. Well next day arrived and she never called to let me know if she was negative or if she was showing up. She also did not try to reschedule, which could either mean her lovely story was a lie and she needed an excuse as to why she may not have showed up. The thing is when you accept a job and then never show up or call to say anything it's just bad manners and indicates what type of person you are.",
