Our house always looks spotless after a cleaning - she takes great care to understand what we need help with most week to week while always giving careful attention to even the hard to reach places. She is always right on time, quick to respond over text, and is just genuinely nice. \r\n\r\nI would highly recommend her to anyone, but especially if you have pets. We have 2 indoor only cats who like to try to slip out the door or otherwise just be nosy when people are over (they want to see what you are up to all the time). Josefina is amazing with them, they love her and I greatly appreciate the text updates she sends on what they are up to! It's a thoughtful gesture that always leaves me with peace of mind when I'm not home.",

She did not, \"copy and paste,\" a response but instead she mentioned key factors I had put in my solicitation. We started chatting back and forth and I immediately set up and interview.\r\n\r\nThe day of the interview she showed up on time and called while at the front door. She didn't want to ring the bell because she knew I had a baby and dogs so already my first impression was spot on and demonstrated just how respectful and courteous she is! \r\n\r\nDuring the interview she was engaged and asked questions and addressed all my concerns. She interacted with my toddler son and really made me feel comfortable with her from the first interaction.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving she said, \"Your house is very beautiful, but you need to be able to come home and relax and spend time with your family. I'd love to come in and do a deep clean so all you have to do is maintain and use your time home in other ways.\"\r\n\r\nShe was hired on the spot because I never mentioned that in my job solicitation, but that is exactly what I was looking for when searching for home cleaning services.\r\n\r\nThe day of the first clean: Ms. Josefina showed up on time and immediately went to work. She asked a few questions about preferences to ensure everything was to my liking and went above and beyond ALL of my expectations!\r\n\r\nShe cleaned and scrubbed things I had no idea needed to be clean! I had set out cleaning products and tools but I was missing a few products she preferred to use on my delicate wood cabinets and microfiber couch. She went to her vehicle and asked my permission to use these products and even offered to run an errand to go to the store to buy these items! \r\n\r\nFrom the moment she showed up at 7:30 a.m. she did not stop once during the 7 hours she was here. Not once, even when I suggested for her to take a break. She is very thorough and has a dedicated work ethic. She even took the time to sanitize things in my son's nursery and explained everything in detail with the work she did in the there to make sure everything was safe and clean for my son. \r\n\r\n(*Very Important*) Originally we had talked about doing a twice a month appointment, but before she left she recommended that I only do a monthly appointment with her. That is a true example of her respectful, honest, loyal and true Christian values. She said she did not feel right taking advantage of us because we definitely didn't need a twice a month appointment. This is her business and livelihood but taking care of her clients like they are her family is her true work ethic style. She showed me how to do light maintenance on the work she did and I finally felt like I have control over this house! \r\n\r\nOverall, my house smelled amazing and was the cleanest I've ever seen it. Ms. Josefina's work definitely exceeded and passed a military cleanliness inspiration! \r\n\r\nIf you are looking for someone with a dedicated, respectfully, honest and outstanding work ethic, I highly recommend Ms. Josefina! \r\n\r\nThank you for your outstanding work and we look forward to your monthly visits!\r\n",
