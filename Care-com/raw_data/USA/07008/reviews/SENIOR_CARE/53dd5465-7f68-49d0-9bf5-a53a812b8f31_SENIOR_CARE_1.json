Bettt was exceptional at the fundamentals of care - administering medications, toileting, washing and dressing my aunt. She also excelled at quality of life care. I would often find them chatting, telling jokes, singing along to my aunt's favorite music. Our family's quality of life improved immediately when Betty took over my aunt's care. We felt none of the stress and worry that we had in previous care-giving situations. I would hire Betty again in a heartbeat.",
