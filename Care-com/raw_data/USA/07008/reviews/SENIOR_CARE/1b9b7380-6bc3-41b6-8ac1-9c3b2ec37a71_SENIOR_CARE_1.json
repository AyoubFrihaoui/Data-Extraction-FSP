She was very flexible and agreeable in many ways.  She took initiative and helped organize a lot of my mother's things. She knows how to administer insulin to my mother and take care of her daily needs. I was very happy with her. Unfortunately, she had a different schedule long term, so could only help us out temporarily. She did a really great job overall. Thank you!",
