My mom has advanced Alzheimer's disease and she is very moody.  Addy came into the picture and helped care for my mom in a most loving, patient and compassionate way.  My mom refers to Addy as her 'friend'.  Addy has assisted us with all of my mom's care needs.  She gets my mom ready, bathes her, grooms her and feeds her, takes her for walks and outings, all with kindness and regardless of my mom's mood swings.  \r\nI work in the corporate world and have sales calls all day.  I never have to worry about my mom when Addy is here.  \r\nI would highly recommend Addy, she's respectful, follows instructions and has kept my mom super happy while I work.  She's accommodating to my long hours and stays as long as I need her too, sometimes up to 50 hours a week.  I am grateful for this angel of a person to have come into our lives during these trying times.",
