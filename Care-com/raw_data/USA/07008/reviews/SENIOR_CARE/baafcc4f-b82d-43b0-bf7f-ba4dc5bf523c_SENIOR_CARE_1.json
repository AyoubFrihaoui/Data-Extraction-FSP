When I told Margaret about a meeting to discuss discharge instructions, she volunteered to meet me there so that she could partake in the discussion. Margaret has always showed up on time, or early. I am so thankful for finding her to care for my husband, who has dementia and parkinsons. Rob is not verbal now, and is confined to a bed or his wheelchair. Margaret is caring, compassionate, and patient. She is gentle when washing him or changing his products, yet thorough. Rob is always clean, and Margaret makes sure to use any creams and ointments necessary to keep Rob from getting bed sores. I can't say enough good things about Margaret. She is an absolute God send and I would recommend her with an outstanding glowing report.",
