She keeps my mom engaged and motivated both physically and mentally. Jineen even helps with my dad whenever needed, and is a great comfort to him as well. Jineen is always prompt and helps with anything that is asked of her including cleaning, cooking and running errands when needed. She is always ready and willing to help. When Jineen is with my mom and dad, I am confident that they are in excellent hands and that gives our family great peace of mind knowing she is there with them! I would highly recommend Jineen to care for your loved one! ",

            "originalText": "Whenever one is considering hiring a care giver for a loved one, there is always the concern of whether they will care for them like we have. When my parents became incapable of living independently, our family considered a care facility. They tried it for two months, and found they were very unhappy and wanted to go home and have a caregiver. We’ve had a few over the years, but as fate would have it, Jineen raised the bar to the level of family. In other words, she cared for both my mother and father with the love, empathy and care as if my folks were hers. In fact, I think they had come to feel Jineen was part of our family. In the beginning, it started as an 8 hour day and as they struggled with various illnesses (kidney disease with my father, dementia with my mother) Jineen transitioned to being their 24 hour caregiver, five days a week with relief on the other two days. From food preparation to doctor’s appointment to medication management, Jineen did it all, always keeping records and updating us on all developments. Jineen is a unique individual; smart, knowledgeable about the variety of medical issues and is very skilled on how to navigate our health care system. We were very lucky and blessed to have her in our lives and we will always be a part of hers. \n",
