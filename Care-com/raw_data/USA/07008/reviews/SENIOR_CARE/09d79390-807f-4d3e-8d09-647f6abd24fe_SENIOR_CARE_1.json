Violeta's duties included all mom's physical care, meal preparation, laundry and light house work.  She drove my mother to doctor appointments and on daily errands using our handicapped van.  She was independent and required very little assistance in caring for mom.  Violeta was exceptionally caring, trustworthy, and patient.  She has common sense, is calm under pressure, and is willing to take charge in a crisis.  She is a rare find, and if you have the opportunity to hire her, don't hesitate.  She will quickly win your appreciation.   ",
