She was reliable, had the patience of a saint, always showed up with a smile, and truly went out of her way to spend quality time with my mom.  I stress \"quality\", because anyone can provide coverage to help watch your elderly relative with dementia, but Jill always looked for activities that would make my mom smile and that she sincerely enjoyed.  Since I lived out of state, she became a trusted partner with me in my mother's care, gave recommendations based on her experience, and became part of the family.   I would highly recommend Jill and would always be open to speak on her behalf as a personal reference.",
