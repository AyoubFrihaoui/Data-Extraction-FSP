I searched on Care.com for someone that provided helper-type services and was very fortunate to have found Beth B.  She has been amazing. Beth is very responsible, reliable, organized, trust worthy, compassionate and caring. \r\nMy parents' heath were deteriorating and Beth was there when I could not be. She ran errands, helped with personal care and transportation.  She made sure that my step mom's hearing aides had fresh batteries and were inserted properly.  If an issue arose she problem solved.  She called after or during each visit to report in and is a great communicator. As the situation evolved it was apparent that they needed full time care. Beth's help while they transitioned to a nursing facility was immense.  Beth continued to see them at the nursing facility which was critical in aiding them in acclimating to their new environment.  Beth even went (off the clock) to visit out of care and concern.",
