Bill helped my dad, who lived alone, with toileting, meals, exercises and companionship. Bill has been attentive to my dad's needs, accompanied him on medical appointments and watched over him during the night hours as well as daytime. Bill was punctual, never missing a day of work and gave the family daily updates on dad's care. Bill's demeanor is caring and gentle which worked well with my dad's dementia. I have only the highest regard for Bill and we are very fortunate to have had Bill in our dad's life and we miss him very much. I am more than happy to speak with anyone interested in hearing more about him. Bill is a definite asset to a senior caregiving situation. THANK YOU BILL FOR ALL YOU DID FOR DAD",
