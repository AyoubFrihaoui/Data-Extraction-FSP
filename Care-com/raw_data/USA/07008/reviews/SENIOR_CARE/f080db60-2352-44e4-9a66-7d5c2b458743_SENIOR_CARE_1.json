Five years is a long time, and our family appreciates the job she did until today. We still keep in touch with Tina until today. She was a part of our lovely family. Tina is a best caregiver we have ever experienced. My grandfather was very happy and content with her humble personality, with her sense of humor and with her caring and friendly personality. I can say she is one of the best  human being. She always kept my grandfather clean and neat shape possible. She took care of his cooking- meal preparation and  medication. Tina kept daily communication with us and informed us about my grandfather. She is very respectful, reliable and trustworthy human being.",

I can confirm that she is a smoker, although her profile states otherwise. Her initial interview and communication stated that she would provide housekeeping, meals and basic care but, requesting those things made her refer to herself as a \"slave\". Her first week or so she was very attentive and helpful but, then things began to slide. Meals would be left out on the counter for hours or overnight then reheated an served for meals. She would routinely allow my father (who is a fall risk) to dress himself and perform daily tasks because she wanted him to exercise and use his muscles. She required my father to go to bed at 8 pm so she could end her night and have personal time because she was working all day. ",
