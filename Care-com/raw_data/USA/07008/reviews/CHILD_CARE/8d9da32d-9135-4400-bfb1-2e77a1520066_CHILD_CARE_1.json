Very energetic and always engaging with him. During naps she would always tidy up the playroom and do any dishes in the sink. She would take our dog for a walk (I work from home so I was always right next to my son's room in case he woke up). She always went the extra mile without ever asking her. Great communication, reliable and just a pleasure to be around. We have since moved away from the area but whole heartedly recommend Olivia to care for your little one. ",
