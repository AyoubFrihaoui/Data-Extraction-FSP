Kids always looked forward to their time with her, whether it's playing creative games, reading stories, or just having a fun afternoon. Josephine consistently went above and beyond, ensuring our kids are well-fed, safe, and entertained, giving us complete peace of mind when we're away. Unfortunately we had to let her go because we moved to a different state. \nWe Highly recommend her to anyone seeking a top-notch babysitter!\n\n\n",
