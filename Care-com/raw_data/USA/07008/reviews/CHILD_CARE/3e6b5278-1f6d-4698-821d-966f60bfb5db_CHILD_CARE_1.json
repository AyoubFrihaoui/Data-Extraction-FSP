To our everlasting disappointment the commute from where she lives to the town we live now is much too long and hard. Our misfortune is going to be someone's fortune now because she's now available to take care of another child. I cannot say enough about what a wonderful job she did with my son and what a nice relationship she built with him. He still asks about her now. She is patient, kind and very safety conscious.  I always knew my son was in great safe hands. You will never be sorry to welcome her into your home. I'm only sorry we had to lose her. \r\n\r\nCrissy\r\n",
