Ashley is kind, loving, energetic, playful, honest and reliable. Since day one Ashley was nothing short of amazing. She kept up with our high energy toddler and was her \"go-go\" girl (as our daughter liked to say. Our daughter was thriving and her vocabulary was expanding daily by being around Ashley. She is punctual, had never missed a day of work and was easy to communicate with. Our home was left tidy and our daughter was safe and always had a smile on her face when she was around Ashley. She has years of experience and multiple references.",
