            "originalText": "We had been working with Corrine (Coco) for over two months, but unfortunately, today, our experience took a very negative turn. During a discussion about safety measures, she made inappropriate and unfair comments, such as, \"If you really cared about your child, you would have everything in place already,\" and, \"How many times do I have to tell you nicely to do something?\" This kind of response felt completely uncalled for and unprofessional.\n\nWhen I attempted to check with her to see if everything was okay, she was visibly upset, sarcastic, and defensive, which made it clear that she was unwilling to have a constructive conversation. While I understand everyone can have a bad day, this level of rudeness was shocking and unacceptable, especially for someone caring for my child. While she was a good babysitter at the time, something obviously happened - and she presented a side of her personality that would get anyone fired at a regular job.  I’ve never encountered such behavior from someone I’ve trusted in my home - and it makes me wonder how she was when I was not around. Sadly, this experience left me feeling uneasy and disappointed, and do not recommend her services.  Because of this incident, I fired her immediately.",

Her nurturing and caring nature has made a profound impact on our family, and we are incredibly grateful for the time she has spent with us. From the beginning, Corrine demonstrated a deep commitment to our daughter’s well-being and development. She collaborated with us to create and implement monthly curriculum and provided thorough, insightful reports on our daughter's progress. Her support extended beyond childcare; she helped with housekeeping and took initiative to ease our workload. Her suggestions regarding meal planning, as well as her creative ideas for activities like arts and crafts, water play, and outings to the park, library, and neighborhood walks, were greatly appreciated. Her Montessori-inspired approach to fostering our daughter’s development and independence transformed our space into a mini classroom, offering a limitless learning experience. Corrine has provided exceptional care and support, and we highly recommend her to any family looking for someone dedicated and skilled. ",

Most of all, on weekends our kid would always say that she couldn't wait to see Ms. Corinne at the beginning of each week. She is so engaging and just a lovely person to have in our home each week. Now that we're going back to in-person camp/school, we definitely plan to book Ms. Corinne for date nights, etc. We feel so fortunate to have found such a caring and compassionate caregiver.",
