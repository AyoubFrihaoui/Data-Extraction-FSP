She's a career nanny with 20+ years of experience that came highly recommended to us by all of her previous families. She's very caring, loving and energetic and made my transition back to work so much easier. My son would get so excited when she walked through the door in the morning. Yolanda kept my son very active, organized playdates, did laundry, prepared nutritious meals, and kept the house very tidy. She's a newborn care specialist, so is very knowledgeable on milestones. She speaks both Spanish and English, has her own car/transportation, and is CPR and First Aid certified.",

When she first started she got him on a schedule and stuck to it. She gave structure to his days and he has thrived on both that and her care. I could leave the house for work and have complete peace of mind that he was in good hands and he always was. She was thoughtful with our pets as well and always made sure to let them outside if they needed to go. My house has never been in more perfect order because of her help, too. She’ll be missed so much. She’s a wealth of knowledge and kindness with so much experience which as new parents- we needed and appreciated. ",

She has become an integral part of our family and our children absolutely adore her (and we do too!). When my son was a newborn she assisted me with all feedings, getting him on a nap schedule and eventually a feeding schedule when he started solid foods. Now that my kids are a bit older (5 and 2) she takes them out during the day, driving them to and from school, to the library etc. She has also potty trained both of my children!! Yolanda is a very hands on caretaker and gives her undivided attention to the children, playing with them, comforting them if they are upset and loving them as if they were her own. Every day I leave the house I have piece of mind knowing my children are in the best hands. I cannot stress enough how wonderful Yolanda is and any family would be extremely lucky to have her!",
