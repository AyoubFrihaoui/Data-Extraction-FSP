She helps prepare and clean up dinner four nights a week and helps our picky eater try new foods. She is communicative, timely, fun, and caring. Our 18 month old runs to the door when she shows up at our house. Drew also has done bedtime routine for our kids for the occasional date night and it has always gone very smoothly. Would highly recommend Drew! ",
