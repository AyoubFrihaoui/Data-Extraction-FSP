We just came to USA last year and my son really had trouble learning because of the language barrier but Sophia was very helpful. She still tutors him even though she completed her student teaching successfully. I see incredible progress of my son every day at school because of the great approach and dedication Sophia provides to him. Strongly recommend her as a teacher and the caregiver. ",
