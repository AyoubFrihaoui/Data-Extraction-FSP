She said wanted to move forward with the job of position. On the day we had agreed to meet when I called to confirm she hung up the phone after saying who I was on two different occasions. I messaged her on Care.com and personal cell and even though messages were seen and read she would not respond. She is not qualified to care for any children and is not a reliable employee based on my experience and I've been in the work industry for over 15 years, never have I seen such childish lack of communication, professionalism and childish behavior from an individual looking for work.",
