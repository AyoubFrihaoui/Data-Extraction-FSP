We had the pleasure of having Cameron care for our son for two years, starting when he was just four months old. From the beginning, he absolutely loved being with her and her family, lighting up every time we dropped him off. Cameron treated him as if he were one of her own, seamlessly integrating him into the Montessori care she provides for her own son.\n\nCameron consistently communicated with us, sending frequent pictures and updates, and was always mindful of asking questions to ensure she was aligned with our family's values and ideals for care. Her warm-hearted and loving nature made us feel safe and secure, knowing our son was in such capable hands.\n\nWe wholeheartedly recommend Cameron to anyone seeking a compassionate and dedicated caretaker.",
