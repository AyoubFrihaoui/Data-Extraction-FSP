Our daughter is a sensitive child, so it was important for us to find someone who understood how her personality. I have been so impressed by Yaira's approach, and how quickly my daughter got accustomed to her. It's also obvious to us that her learning and development has accelerated since Yaira started watching her. She ensures that the day is filled with a combination of reading, playing, outdoor time and creative activities. \nSecondly, she is a great help to us as parents. She has easily taken any instruction we've given, she is solution oriented, and always curious how she can be more helpful. Also, despite play and fun, the house is always spotless. ",
