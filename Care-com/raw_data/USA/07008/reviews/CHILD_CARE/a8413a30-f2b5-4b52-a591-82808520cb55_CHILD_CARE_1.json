The woman had offered her $5 an hour and Stacy politely recommended hiring an aupair. Stacy has been taking care of my boy(8) and girl(3) on and off when my husband and I need her. She has been amazing and our kids call her aunt Stacy and miss her so dearly when she leaves. We took the whole family to Key West for her wedding and her husband joins us for dinner occasionally. Stacy is ALWAYS the first person I call when I need help with the kids, we have an ongoing conversation over text as well because she’s part of our family now. I can’t wait for her to have kids of her own, she will be a great mother.",

I ran into one of the neighbors at a birthday party months ago and when she saw the kids she stopped me to tell me that I have the absolutely best nanny- she said she sees them in the park and Stacy is always playing with them and watching them closely while she often sees other nanny’s on their phone and disinterested in the kids. I did not know this person before the party so that feedback was really great. Stacy is honest and transparent in communication. She is flexible and so easy to work with. I would be more than happy to talk to anyone interested in hiring Stacy- i think it’s really hard to find someone as good as her.",
