My little one had a nose bleed, and Tamisha texted me right away (although I didn't see the text until later) and took care of him, and when I came downstairs, she told me about it and shared her similar experience with her kid. In addition, Tamisha is easy going, when we told her we want her to take off her shoes (and feel free to bring indoor shoes/slippers), she didn't have problem at all. Plus, when she arrived, she easily backed her SUV into our driveway --- a good driver (much better than myself)! We had a great first experience with her and look forward to getting her help again!",
