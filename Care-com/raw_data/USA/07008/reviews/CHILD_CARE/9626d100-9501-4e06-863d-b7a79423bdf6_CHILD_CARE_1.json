Our prior caregiver had moved to a different State and we were waiting for our au pair to arrive from Ecuador. Had we not already committed to having an au pair, we would have hired Ashley. Ashley is a pleasure to have around. She is professional, reliable, punctual - but most importantly, she is kind and warm and wonderful with kids. Our children were ages 4, 2, and 1 year old triplets when she worked with us. She took it all in stride and just fit right into our routine. She even managed to get our babies to hold their own bottles - which was a huge achievement and an important one - especially with triplets! If we had the need and opportunity, we would definitely hire Ashley again!",
