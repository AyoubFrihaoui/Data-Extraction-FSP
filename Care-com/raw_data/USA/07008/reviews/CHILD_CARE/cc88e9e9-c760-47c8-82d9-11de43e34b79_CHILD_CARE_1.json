Her presence was not just about watching our little one; it was about truly engaging with them. She filled each day with creativity, patience, and genuine affection.\n\nHer ability to connect with our baby was remarkable. Whether it was through playful interactions, or just quiet moments of being present, she always knew how to make our child feel secure and cherished. It was evident that she has incredible work ethic and punctuality.\n\nWhat impressed us the most was her patience. Navigating the ups and downs of infancy can be challenging, but she handled every situation with grace and understanding. Her calm demeanor helped create a nurturing environment where our baby could thrive.\n\nWe felt so at ease knowing our child was in such loving hands. Her commitment to our family went beyond the basics. We cannot recommend her highly enough. Thank you for everything—you truly made a difference in our lives! Also, we miss you :(! ",
