My husband and I interviewed Samantha a few months before our daughter was born.  From the very first meeting we were impressed with her intelligence, certifications and experience. We knew we had met someone very special and needed to hire her right away!  During my maternity leave, Samantha visited often to get to know us and our baby.  This truly helped with my return to work.\r\n\r\nSamantha has been with our family for two years and I can say with confidence, that Samantha has made the utmost impact on our daughter and is part of our family. The love, attention she has given our daughter goes far beyond caring for basic needs.  She nurtures her, guides her and sets examples and boundaries to help her grow.  While we know it is the right time for our daughter to go to school, we will miss Samantha terribly! You and your child will be so lucky to have her!",
