She disarmed my eldest son (she has a natural way with children), and comforted me with her encouraging way. \n\nOver the course of a year, Ritch became part of the family. Ritch has a background in preschool education, which shows through in her creative techniques, knowledge of conflict resolution, and perfectly equilibrated soft style. \n\nA typical day might involve dancing to the Wiggles, combining arts and crafts and learning the numbers, and a fresh and healthy snack. \n\nWe really bonded, my kids LOVED her, and I recommend her to the highest degree. My entire family will miss her dearly.",
