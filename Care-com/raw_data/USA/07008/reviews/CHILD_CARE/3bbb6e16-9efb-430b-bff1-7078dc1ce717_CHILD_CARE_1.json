Lilia is extremely efficient, never leaves a mess, continuously goes beyond what I expected and we agreed on (i.e. noticing the carpet on the 14 steps had some stains so she scrubbed the carpet getting out every stain) and some much more. She never ceases to amaze me with her cleaning and wonderful personality.  If she sees something its picked up or cleaned even though that room or place was not included on our arrangements and never expects anything more from me.  Lilia just wants. To be the best and she is.  In all the years I've had this help Lilia I'd the very first person I've ever paid extra.  She tries hard to not accept it,  but she is \"all that and much more\".  You will never regret hiring Lilia.    \r\n\r\n",
