If you connect with her and she seems like a good fit please call me so I can tell you all about her. She worked for us for three years and lovingly cared for our two daughters. The commute to our house was too far for her and she had to find employment closer to home but we were so sorry to see her go and she is still a part of our family. Any family would be truly lucky to have her. I know how difficult finding the right nanny can be but if you have found Elisete you are well on your way. She is a lovely person through and through.
