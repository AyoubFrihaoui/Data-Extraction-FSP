            "originalText": "My family loves  Krystal. Krystal has been with our family for over a year now and has taken great care of our 3 year old son, who is on the spectrum. She takes her time with him teaches him new things all the time. She is wonderful at creating activities and projects with him. I know Krystal also has a background in child care centers that is the main reason we hired her for him cause he needs a playful nanny/sitter and structure all at the same time. Krystal is very punctual if not early. Very kind hearted and loving and just has a mother’s touch to her or some should say big sister.  In my experience with her anyone that would hire her is hiring a prize! Trusting someone with your children is very hard but with Krystal it came with ease. She is great with communication regardless what is needed for our son and also about how he is doing through this time with her, snack times and lunch times and or dinner times are normally hard but krystal has gotten my son to sit down and eat with her. Also potty training has been so easy Krystal has some really good ideas and helpful hints for him. Over all Krystal would make a great addition to any family looking for a nanny! ",
