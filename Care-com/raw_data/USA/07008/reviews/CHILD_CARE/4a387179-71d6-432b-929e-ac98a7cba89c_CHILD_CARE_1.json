However, she was not very friendly or playful with them, and somewhat terse about their needs and bodily functions. For example, she asked why they kept spitting up (because they are newborns) and openly expressed disgust about their poop/gas. She was flexible about scheduling so that was helpful.

She takes pride in her appearance and treats children as if they were her own making sure they are fed, dressed, and ready for either school or any activity that they partake in. It was really important for me to find someone who would take good care of an infant and after interviewing her I decided to give her a shot and I can say it was one of the best choices I made.
