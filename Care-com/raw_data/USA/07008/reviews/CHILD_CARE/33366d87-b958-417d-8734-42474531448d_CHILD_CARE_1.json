She was prompt and stuck to our schedule which was important for me given my work schedule. \n\nMassiel genuinely cares about children and their well-being and it shows! She was attentive, nurturing, and always engages our son.\nAside from this my son totally grew to love being around her and made this whole transition to getting a nanny an easy one!  ",
