She is easy to communicate with and extremely professional in how she approaches the job, always punctual if not early, and pitches in so that we can end our work day in a restful home. \r\n\r\nOur son loves her because she patiently reads books to him (even making a good effort on the non-English books!), sings songs, comes up with fun sensory and art activities, and generally treats him respectfully and includes him in all care giving, in line with the RIE philosophy. It really makes a difference in how independent he feels, which benefits all of us.\r\n\r\nOur setup was that Bridget would bring her own daughter (4 years old) with her through the summer. The two children had a great time together and if they ever did clash, Bridget always set boundaries fairly and firmly. \r\n\r\nI'm going on maternity leave for a few months but would rehire her in a heartbeat.",
