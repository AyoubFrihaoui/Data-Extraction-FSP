            "displayText": "Our family had the pleasure of having Layla join us for over a year (though frankly she is still very much part of our family). She helped raise our toddler and newborn . Layla has one of the best work ethics I have seen in all of my years of working. She is punctual, patient, warm, loving, and fun. Layla is independent, needs very little direction, and is proactive when it comes to finding play dates, organizing activities, and helping our son socialize, which we had expressed as important for us. Layla loves our children as if they are her own. We have hundreds of pictures of her with the kids and you can see the pure joy and love on their faces. I could go on and on, but I will end by saying there is no greater gift you can give a mother than truly loving and caring for her children - and Layla does just that.",
