I paid for her background record check. On the day on the joining she said she is sick and cannot join that day, after that she neither replied to any of my messages or calls nor did she provide an update of any kind on how she was doing or whether she was going to join. It was highly unprofessional. I had to deal with taking time off of my work, managing kids schedule around, paying care.com fees for re-interviewing babysitters, lot of stress from all of this being last minute and being in the limbo from not hearing back from her.
