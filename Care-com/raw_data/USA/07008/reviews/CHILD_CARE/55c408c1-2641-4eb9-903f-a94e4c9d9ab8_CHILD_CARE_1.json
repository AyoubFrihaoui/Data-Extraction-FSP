Thais has been great with our two children (1 and 5), she treats them like they are her own and we see her as part of the family. She is kind, will role her sleeves up and get in a fort or play make believe and is also able to get them to calm down when they are having their moments. She does a great job of being able to engage both kids in activities together despite the age difference. \r\n\r\nThais is also a good communicator with us about how the day went and any issues that came up. You can tell she has been doing this for while. She is always on time.  She will definitely be missed at our house.",
