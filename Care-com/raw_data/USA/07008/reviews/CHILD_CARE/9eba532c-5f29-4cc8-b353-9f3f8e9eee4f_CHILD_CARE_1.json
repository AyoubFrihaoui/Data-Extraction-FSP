She was always friendly, fun and professional and got along great with everyone.  I really appreciated that she was consistently reliable and timely when arriving and picking my kids up from school and after school activities.  I could depend on her to have delicious meals ready for them, to help my younger one with homework when asked, and to keep in communication with them since the time they needed rides sometimes varied every day depending on variable schedules.  \r\n\r\nI found that Victoria always had a great attitude, was flexible and responsive and communicated regularly with me for updates and on how to make our afternoons flow smoothly and to help me have everything in good order so that I could spend quality time with my family when I got home from work.   I definitely recommend her!",
