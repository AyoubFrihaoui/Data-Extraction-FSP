She was very personable and nice to be around in our home. At first our boy was clingy and upset to be left with someone new, but by the end of her time with us he was very excited to see her when she arrived. She read him a lot of books, took him for walks and talked to him a lot, showing him things around the house and neighborhood. She even wrote a nice letter of tips and tricks for the new nanny, which showed how thoughtful she was. She was happy to take instructions and do things the way we ask. She kept us updated on the app that we use and by sending photos during the day. We appreciated having her help and were sad to see her go. ",

She has been taking care of our little girl since she were just a few months old, and she is now 20 months old. Malka is an incredibly warm and friendly person who always has a positive attitude about life. She is extremely attentive, playful, engaging, gentle, loving, and caring, making her an absolute joy to work with. When she knocks at the door, our daughter runs to greet her now, its seriously adorable!\n\nMalka goes above and beyond when it comes to taking care of our daughter. She prepares delicious meals, cleans up after every activity, and even helps with household chores such as folding laundry, cleaning the dishes, and sweeping. We have recommended her to a friend who has multiple children of different ages, and they have told me how impressed they were with her care, attentiveness, and how creative she was with different activities to do with the kids.\n\nAlthough our daughter now attends daycare during the week, we still have Malka come over for date nights or on the weekends. She is always willing to accommodate our schedule, and we really appreciate her flexibility.\n\nOverall, we highly recommend Malka as a caregiver for your children. She is an exceptional person who truly cares about the well-being of the children she looks after. You will not be disappointed!",
