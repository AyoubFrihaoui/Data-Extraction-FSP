Additionally, my son really loves Sol and looks forward to seeing her every day. From the moment she comes in, he asks her to pick him up and he is ready to play. It is incredibly reassuring to me that my son has bonded with Sol. Additionally, Sol has a driver's license and drives him to his play dates (some of them she has made using her nanny network), to his music class, to the pool and to his gym classes. Sol has also traveled with us out of town which made it easy for me to enjoy time with friends. I have really enjoyed having Sol as my nanny over these past few months and we will miss her very much. I certainly know that any family will be lucky to have Sol!",
