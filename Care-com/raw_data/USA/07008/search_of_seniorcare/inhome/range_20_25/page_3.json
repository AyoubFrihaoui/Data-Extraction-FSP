I have been told that I can be quite the social butterfly. I absolutely love listening to old stories from back in the day. I enjoy helping one as needed and keeping them in good company. Putting a smile on ones face is the best part of the day. Helping a loved one get back on their feet, helping them to gain strength, to succeed in everyday tasks. I live in Staten Island. If you and your family have any other questions, please feel free to contact me. I look forward to hearing from you and hope to care for your loved ones! \n\n\nThank you\nCrystal",
